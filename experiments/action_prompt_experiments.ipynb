        "   - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n",
        "   - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n",
        "   This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n",
        "   - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n",
        "   - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n",
