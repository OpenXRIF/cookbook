For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user is giving a detailed set of instructions about moving through various waypoints in some sort of environment, probably a simulation or game. \n\nFirst, the main action is for Robot to start at the North Entrance. So I need to translate \"North Entrance\" into one of the known waypoints. Looking back, there's no waypoint named exactly that, but maybe it refers to an area like RoboHub or another nearby checkpoint. Wait, actually, in the provided data, there are waypoints starting with specific words, so perhaps North Entrance is considered a waypoint that needs to be navigated.\n\nNext, after starting at North Entrance, Robot has to proceed to C&D - Main Entrance. That's clearly defined and exists as \"C&D - Main Entrance\" with x: 0, y: 105 in the data.\n\nThen, check for obstructions at C&D - Main Entrance. Since that's a waypoint, it implies stopping there to inspect. So Robot needs to wait here until everything is clear before moving on.\n\nAfter that, visit Microwaves area and ensure all units are operational. Wait, Microwaves isn't listed in the data. Hmm, maybe it's an internal area or another known waypoint I missed? Looking back at the waypoints, there's \"RoboHub\" but nothing called Microwaves. So perhaps this is a problem because Microwaves doesn't exist. The user might have meant a different area like \"Microwave Oven\" or a specific room code.\n\nMoving on, after Microwaves (assuming it exists), go to Silent Study and verify the environment remains quiet. Silent Study does exist in the data as x: 0, y: 215. So that's doable.\n\nThen, navigate to Shower A and Shower B to inspect for cleanliness. Both Shower A and B are defined with coordinates 951,616 and 834,579 respectively. So Robot will need to go to both areas one after the other?\n\nFinally, head to South Entrance and report back. South Entrance isn't a waypoint in the data provided, so that might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Microwaves area\" refers to a different known waypoint or maybe it's intended as a placeholder for another area that exists but wasn't listed here. Similarly, \"South Entrance\" isn't present either. Since both are missing from the available waypoints, the robot can't proceed accurately.\n\nAdditionally, after visiting all these areas, Robot needs to report back, which would require a communication action like \"speak\". But since the data doesn't include South Entrance or Microwaves area, any navigation attempt there would result in an unknown waypoint and thus an error message from the system.\n\nIn summary, most of the waypoints mentioned exist except for North Entrance, Microwaves area, and South Entrance. Since these are missing, the instructions can't be fully executed as-is. Therefore, the output should include a fallback action indicating that some waypoints don't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Microwaves area' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'North Entrance' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
