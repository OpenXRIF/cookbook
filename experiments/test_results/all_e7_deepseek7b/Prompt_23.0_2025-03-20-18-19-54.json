For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assemble Room.\"\n",

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this prompt: \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assemble Room.\" I need to figure out how to respond using the given waypoints. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if both \"Ideas Clinic\" and \"Assemble Room\" are valid waypoints from the list provided. Looking through the waypoints:\n\n- Ideas Clinic is listed as \"Ideas Clinic\", so that's good.\n- Assemble Room isn't explicitly mentioned in the list of waypoints, but there might be a typo or it could refer to something else like a room number.\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\". But where is the Assemble Room? It's not listed. So maybe the user meant another location. Since \"Assemble Room\" isn't in the known waypoints, it might be considered unknown.\n\nAccording to the instructions, if a waypoint isn't found, I have to output an action with \"speak\": \"This waypoint does not exist\". But since there are two parts here, navigating and then going somewhere else, I need to handle this correctly.\n\nBut wait, in complex commands, if multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. So maybe it's better to first navigate to Ideas Clinic because that's valid, but then Assemble Room isn't known. So perhaps I can only execute part of the command.\n\nHowever, the prompt says \"then go to\", so I need both steps. Since Assemble Room is unknown, I can't proceed fully. But how should I handle this?\n\nLooking at the examples provided, when a waypoint is unknown, it results in an action with speak and the error message. Also, if multiple interpretations are possible but some parts are invalid, perhaps only part of the command is executed.\n\nBut according to the handling complex commands section: process in left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So first navigate to Ideas Clinic, then go to Assemble Room. But since Assemble Room isn't known, maybe I have to output an error for that step.\n\nWait, but the example given when both are unknown was just a single speak action with \"Invalid request\". Hmm. Alternatively, if one is valid and another is not, perhaps only perform the possible part.\n\nBut according to the supported edge cases: if any waypoint is unknown, return actions indicating it's invalid or ambiguous commands result in a single speak action with an error message. So since Assemble Room isn't known, I can't proceed beyond Ideas Clinic.\n\nTherefore, maybe I should output \"invalid\" because one of the steps requires an unknown waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Assemble Room' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
