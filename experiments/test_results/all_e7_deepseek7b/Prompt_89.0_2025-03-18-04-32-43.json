    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: \"Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the structure of the commands. The user seems to be giving two instructions here: moving to a specific location and then saying something at that location. I remember from the examples that when there are multiple steps, the actions should be output in the order they should be executed. So navigation followed by speaking makes sense.\n\nLooking at the available functions, it's \"navigate\", \"speak\", and \"wait\". The user didn't mention waiting, so maybe it won't be needed here.\n\nI need to check if the waypoint called \"North Entrance\" exists. From the list provided earlier, yes, there is a North Entrance with coordinates (0.0, 0.0). So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, structuring the actions. The first action should be navigating to the North Entrance. Then, immediately after arriving, I need to make sure the user says \"North Entrance\" out loud. Since both commands are sequential and there's no mention of waiting or other steps, I can combine them into two separate actions without any wait time.\n\nI don't see any edge cases here because the waypoint exists. There's no unknown zone mentioned, so that wouldn't be a problem.\n\nSo putting it all together, the first action is navigate to North Entrance at (0,0), and the second action is speak \"North Entrance\". That should fulfill the user's request correctly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 0.0,\n        \"y\": 0.0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"North Entrance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
