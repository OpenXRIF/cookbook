    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the starting location which is (0.0, 0.0). The user wants me to navigate to a specific waypoint called \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nI remember from the provided data that there are several waypoints listed under different sections like Coffee Area, RoboHub, etc., but none of them are explicitly named \"E7 silent study.\" Let me check through the list:\n\n- There's an E5 and E6 in the Coffee Area, but not E7.\n- Other areas have places like Ideas Clinic, RoboHub, and others, but nothing matches E7.\n\nSo, it seems like there's no waypoint named \"E7 silent study\" listed. According to the instructions, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following all the steps correctly. The process involves normalization where both the user's input and the waypoint names are converted to lowercase. Then, extraneous tokens are removed if they start with letters and digits. Tokenization is done on the cleaned inputs, and similarity is checked based on token presence.\n\nIn this case, \"E7 silent study\" would be normalized to \"e7 silent study.\" Looking through the waypoints, none of them match these tokens after cleaning. So, no known waypoint meets or exceeds 80% similarity because there are zero matching tokens from the user's input for any existing waypoint.\n\nTherefore, I should respond by speaking that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe waypoint \"E7 silent study\" does not exist in the provided list of waypoints.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: E7 silent study\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
