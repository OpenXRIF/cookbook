For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need to fresen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wate 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user says they want to \"freshen up,\" which I think means they need a shower. So they're asking for a sequence of actions: take them to Shower A, then to Shower B, wait for a minute at Shower B, and then continue on.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I see Shower A is listed under the East Side with coordinates (0, 616) and Shower B is also under East Side at (0, 618). Wait, no, actually, looking back, Shower A is at X=0, Y=616? Or maybe I misread. Let me check.\n\nWait, the provided waypoints include:\n- Shower A: X=?, Y=? (I think it's in E5 Entrance but not sure)\nActually, under the starting locations and available functions, the user can navigate to any waypoint with their coordinates. The specific wayponts listed are things like C&D Coffee Area at 100,100.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify where Shower A is exactly. Looking back, in the list of waypoints, I see E5 Entrance has X=1535, Y=1535, but that's a different area. Shower A is mentioned under the East Side with \"Shower A are Clean, Wash, 1918.\" Wait, no, perhaps it's in another section.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the waypoints again:\n\n- C&D Coffee Area: X=?, Y=?\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic: X=?, Y=?\n- Room 501 Design Teams: X=?, Y=?\n- E5 Entrance: X=1535, Y=1535\n- E1 Entrance: maybe not listed here.\n\nWait, the user's prompt mentions \"Take me to Shower A\" and \"Shower B.\" So I need to check if these are defined as waypoints. Looking through the list:\n\nI see under the starting locations that there's a waypoint called E5 Entrance with X=1535, Y=1535. But where are the showers? Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps in another part of the data: The user lists various wayponts like \"Room 100 - Shower A\" but I don't see it here. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, no\u2014looking back at the initial data provided by the user, they didn't list specific coordinates for all waypoints except C&D areas.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the user's original data doesn't include the exact coordinates of Shower A and B? That could be an issue because without knowing their X and Y, I can't navigate to them. So if the user is asking for \"Take me to Shower A\" but it's not listed with coordinates, then the system might not know where that is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user assumes that all wayponts are accessible via their names regardless of coordinates, but according to the problem statement, navigation requires knowing X and Y. So if Shower A isn't specified, maybe I have to default to a specific coordinate or assume it's known somehow.\n\nBut looking at the initial data, the only coordinates provided are for C&D areas (e.g., 100,100) under various wayponts. But in reality, each waypoint should have its own X and Y. Without that information, I can't proceed accurately.\n\nAssuming that each waypoint like C&D Coffee Area has a specific coordinate, perhaps the user expects me to know where they are. So if the user says \"Take me to Shower A,\" but I don't have its coordinates, maybe I should respond with an error or ask for more information.\n\nBut since the prompt is expecting a response, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user's example prompts include commands that require specific waypoints and their coordinates. So in this case, since the user wants to go to Shower A and then B, but without knowing their exact locations, the system can't proceed.\n\nWait, maybe the user is using a different way of referencing waypoints by name regardless of their position, similar to how the example used C&D - Coffee Area at (100,100). But in reality, each waypoint should have its own X and Y. So perhaps I'm supposed to assume that \"Shower A\" has coordinates like 612, something? Wait, no\u2014earlier, in the list, there's a point under E5 Entrance at (1535,1535), but that's another area.\n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to know their relative positions. For instance, if Shower A and B are near each other on the East Side, perhaps I can navigate from one to the other without exact coordinates. But that doesn't make sense because navigation requires specific X and Y values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is simplifying and just wants the sequence of actions: go to shower A, then shower B, wait a minute, then continue. So perhaps they don't need the exact coordinates but just the instructions on how to proceed.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each navigation requires knowing X and Y for each waypoint. So without those, I can't perform the action. Therefore, perhaps the user's prompt is incomplete or assumes that the system knows the wayponts by name with their own default coordinates.\n\nIn any case, proceeding step by step:\n\n1. The user says they need to \"freshen up,\" implying a shower.\n2. They request a sequence: Shower A \u2192 Shower B \u2192 wait 1 minute at B \u2192 continue.\n\nGiven that, and without exact coordinates for each, the system can't navigate accurately. But maybe in this context, it's acceptable to assume default coordinates or proceed with relative positioning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is testing if the system knows how to handle sequences of actions despite missing waypoints. In that case, the system might list all known showers and their positions, then ask for confirmation.\n\nBut given the initial data doesn't provide specific X,Y values for each waypont except C&D areas at 100,100, perhaps I should proceed with those as default coordinates.\n\nWait, looking back: The user lists \"Room 501 Design Teams\" and others but only provides specific X,Y for a few. Maybe the system expects that all wayponts have their own unique X,Y assigned elsewhere, which aren't listed here.\n\nSo without knowing where each waypont is, I can't navigate accurately to Shower A or B. Therefore, perhaps I should respond with an error message or ask for clarification on the coordinates of these showers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to know that the showers are in a specific area and use relative positioning, but that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nIn conclusion, due to missing information about the exact X,Y coordinates for Shower A and B, I can't accurately navigate to them. Therefore, I should inform the user that their request can't be fulfilled without knowing where these wayponts are located.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill your request as I don't have the specific X,Y coordinates for Shower A and Shower B.
