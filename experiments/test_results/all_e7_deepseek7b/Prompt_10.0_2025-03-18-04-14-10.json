    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says, \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the user is asking for. They want someone to start from the Microwaves and then guide them back to the E5 Entrance. So essentially, they're asking for navigation instructions from one waypoint to another.\n\nLooking at the available functions, we have \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" and \"wait.\" Since the user isn't asking to do anything besides navigate from one point to another, I think \"navigate\" is sufficient here. They don't seem to need any speaking or waiting actions unless there's more complexity, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nI should check if both waypoints\u2014the Microwaves and E5 Entrance\u2014are known. From the list of starting locations and available functions, E5 Entrance is listed as a waypoint at (25, 50). But I don't see any entry for \"Microwaves.\" Hmm, that's an issue because if it's not a defined waypoint, we can't navigate to it.\n\nSo, since \"Microwaves\" isn't recognized, the system should respond with a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. Then, maybe ask for clarification on which waypoint they're referring to. That way, the user can provide more details or correct the waypoint name if it's incorrect.\n\nPutting this together, the response should first acknowledge the lack of knowledge about \"Microwaves\" and then prompt the user to specify the waypoints again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'microwave' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 50\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
