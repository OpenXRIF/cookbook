For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, proceed to [[Elevators]], say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation, and wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote: \"Robot, proceed to [[Elevators]], say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation, and wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what they're asking for. It seems like a command involving navigation actions. The structure mentions going to [[Elevators]], which probably refers to the Elevators waypoint.\n\nSo, breaking it down step by step:\n\n1. The user starts with \"Robot,\" but that might be unnecessary or just emphasizing something.\n2. They say \"proceed to [[Elevators]]\". So the first action is to navigate to the Elevators waypoint.\n3. Then they mention saying \"Elevators\" for assistance, which I think means after arriving at the Elevators, they want someone there to help with navigation.\n4. After that, they want to wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\n\nWait, but in terms of actions, can you combine navigate and speak? Or is it one action each?\n\nI recall from the examples given earlier that if a command includes multiple steps, the actions are output in left-to-right sequence unless stated otherwise. So first navigate to Elevators, then perform an action like speaking with \"Elevators\" after arriving there.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, they had two separate speak actions: one before moving and another after reaching a point. But actually, looking at the examples, sometimes it's just navigating multiple times or combining with other functions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that after moving to Elevators, the robot should say \"Elevators\" to get assistance and then wait for 5 minutes. So two actions: navigate to Elevators, speak to request help from there, and wait.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they had a structure where navigation commands are separate actions, followed by speaks and waits as needed.\n\nSo maybe:\n\n1. First action is to navigate to [[Elevators]].\n2. Then say \"Elevators\" using speak with that input.\n3. Then wait for 5 minutes.\n\nBut according to the supported edge cases, if an unknown waypoint is encountered, it should return a speak action saying it doesn't exist. But in this case, Elevators seems to be a known waypoint since the user refers to it as [[Elevators]].\n\nWait, but I need to check if [[Elevators]] corresponds to a real waypoint name. From earlier data, the waypoints under Elevators aren't listed here, so maybe it's an unknown waypoint? Or is [[Elevators]] actually referring to a specific waypoint like \"Elevators\" or another name?\n\nWait no, looking back at the user's provided waypoints, there isn't one named [[Elevators]]. But in the example prompt given earlier, \"Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\" was translated to a navigate action.\n\nSo perhaps [[Elevators]] is just a placeholder or an internal reference. Maybe it's intended as an unknown waypoint? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, if [[Elevators]] isn't in the list of known waypoints, then the robot should speak that it doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, in the user's prompt, they specifically use [[Elevators]], which might be a placeholder for the actual name. Since in their data, the only waypoint with Elevator is not listed under C&D areas but elsewhere? Wait, checking earlier data: no, actually there are two waypoints under Elevators:\n\nWait no, looking back at the user's provided data, I don't see any waypints named \"Elevators\". So maybe [[Elevators]] isn't a known waypoint. Therefore, when the robot tries to navigate there, it should return that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, in their data, under C&D areas, they have [[C&D - Coffee Area]], but no mention of Elevators. So perhaps [[Elevators]] is an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo following the edge case: if a waypoint is unknown, output \"This waypoint does not exist\" with action speak.\n\nTherefore, first, the robot would navigate to wherever it's currently located, which from starting point is (0,0). Since there are no known waypoints in C&D areas except Coffee Area. Wait, but in the initial data, under C&D - Coffee Area, coordinates are 100,100. So perhaps the user wants to go to that.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me try to structure this step by step.\n\n1. The prompt is: \"Robot, proceed to [[Elevators]], say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation, and wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\"\n\n2. Breaking it down:\n   a. Proceed to [[Elevators]]: navigate there.\n   b. Say \"Elevators\": perhaps after arriving, the robot speaks this message.\n   c. Wait for 5 minutes: perform a wait action.\n\n3. First, navigation command to [[Elevators]]. But from the data provided earlier, under C&D areas and Elevators, I don't see any specific waypoint named [[Elevators]], so it's an unknown waypoint.\n\n4. Therefore, moving to [[Elevators]] would result in a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\n5. Then, after attempting that, the next part is to say \"Elevators\" as per instruction, but since [[Elevators]] doesn't exist, maybe it's an error or perhaps the user intended another waypoint.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps [[Elevators]] refers to a real waypoint under Elevators section, which from earlier data: no, because in their initial list, they only mention C&D - Coffee Area and other areas like A1, A2 etc., but not under Elevators.\n\nSo yes, it's likely an unknown waypoint. Therefore, the first action is navigate to [[Elevators]], which will result in \"This waypoint does not exist\" with a speak action.\n\nThen, perhaps after that failure, the robot should proceed as if trying again or maybe handle the next part of the command. But I think since navigation failed, it's stuck there unless another way exists.\n\nBut according to the user\u2019s prompt, they want to say \"Elevators\", which might be intended as an action once at that location.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is using [[Elevators]] as a placeholder for actual coordinates or waypoints. But without knowing, I have to assume it's unknown.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is:\n\n1. Attempt to navigate to [[Elevators]], resulting in \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\n2. Then perform the speak action with message \"Elevators\" (but since it doesn't exist, maybe that's an error or perhaps we should ignore it).\n\n3. Then wait for 5 minutes.\n\nBut in terms of actions, probably:\n\n- First: navigate to [[Elevators]], which is unknown \u2192 speak action.\n- Second: say \"Elevators\" as per instruction (but since the waypoint doesn't exist, maybe this step isn't possible).\n- Third: wait for 5 minutes.\n\nSo the robot would first try to move to an unknown location and fail with a speak action. Then attempt to say something about it again but without success. Finally, perform a wait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is flawed because moving to [[Elevators]] isn't possible, so the robot should terminate or respond accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe user's prompt involves navigating to an unknown waypoint (likely referred to as [[Elevators]]) and then performing subsequent actions based on that navigation attempt. Here's a structured response:\n\n1. **Navigation Attempt**: The robot attempts to move to the waypoint named [[Elevators]]. Since this is not recognized, it returns \"This waypoint does not exist\" using a speak action.\n\n2. **Speaking Action**: After the navigation failure, the robot tries to say \"Elevators,\" but since the waypoint isn't found, there's no valid content for this action.\n\n3. **Waiting Action**: The robot then waits for 5 minutes as instructed.\n\n**Final Actions:**\n- **Speak**: \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n- **Wait**: For 5 minutes.\n\nPlease note that due to the unknown nature of [[Elevators]], some parts of the command may be inapplicable or require further clarification.",
