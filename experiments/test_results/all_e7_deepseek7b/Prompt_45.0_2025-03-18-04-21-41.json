    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Based on the provided guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll identify if there are known waypoints. From the list, I see Microwaves at (100,20) but not E5 Entrance because that's part of the starting location in the example.\n\nSince E5 isn't a recognized waypoint and Microwaves is, I can only partially fulfill the request. According to the rules, if no known waypoints meet the threshold, output \"speak\" with an error message.\n\nSo, my response will be a speak action informing that the E5 Entrance doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"E5 Entrance is not a known waypoint. Please specify another location or use 'unknown' to continue.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
