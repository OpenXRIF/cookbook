    "Prompt": "\"Robot, begin at the North Entrance and proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance to check for any obstructions. Next, visit the Microwaves area and ensure all units are operational. After that, move to Silent Study and verify that the environment remains quiet. Then, navigate to Shower A and Shower B to inspect for cleanliness. Finally, head to the South Entrance and report back with your findings.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt using the given waypoints and functions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is telling a robot several tasks: starting at the North Entrance, then moving through several areas, checking for obstructions, microwaves, environment, etc., and finally reporting back after inspecting Showers A and B at the South Entrance.\n\nI need to make sure each of these steps corresponds to the available waypoints. Let me list out the available ways:\n\n- North Entrance\n- C&D - Coffee Area (which is similar but not exactly Main Entrance)\n- Microwaves area \u2013 but that's an unknown because it's not listed as a waypoint\n- Silent Study\n- Shower A and B\n\nWait, the user mentions \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" which isn't explicitly in the list. The closest is C&D - Coffee Area. So maybe they meant that? Or perhaps I should assume it's a different location but close enough.\n\nThe Microwaves area is an unknown because there's no waypoint listed for it, so that might cause an error or fallback to speak.\n\nSilent Study is in the list as \"Silent Study\" under another name. The South Entrance corresponds to \"South Entrance.\"\n\nNow, processing each step:\n\n1. Start at North Entrance: Yes, available.\n2. Proceed to C&D - Main Entrance: Since there's no exact waypoint, maybe use C&D - Coffee Area instead or note it's unclear.\n3. Visit Microwaves area \u2013 unknown, so this might cause an issue.\n4. Silent Study \u2013 exists as \"Silent Study.\"\n5. Check Shower A and B \u2013 available.\n\nSince the user mentions microwaves, which is unknown, that step can't be completed because there's no such waypoint. So when processing the command, I should return an error about that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the robot would need to navigate through each known waypoint but would have to speak about the unknown Microwaves area.\n</think>\n\nThe robot will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigate** from North Entrance to C&D - Coffee Area (assuming Main Entrance is a typo).\n2. **Speak** about the unknown Microwaves area, as it's not a listed waypoint.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": ..., \n        \"y\": ...\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\", \n      \"input\": \"The Microwaves area is not a known waypoint.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
