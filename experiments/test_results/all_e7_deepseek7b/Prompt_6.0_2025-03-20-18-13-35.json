For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they want to \"freshen up,\" which I assume means they need a place to wash or shower. They list two showers: Shower A and Shower B. The coordinates for both are given as (1427 - Room 1427) for Shower A and (616 - I'm not sure where that number comes from, maybe it's another room?) for Shower B.\n\nSo the first action is to take them to Shower A at Room 1427. Then to Shower B at Room 616. After arriving there, they need to wait 1 minute before proceeding.\n\nLooking back at the supported commands and examples, I see that the commands should be processed left-to-right unless told otherwise. The example with multiple steps resulted in a sequence of navigate actions followed by speak and wait.\n\nI should check if both Shower A and Shower B are valid waypoints from the list provided. From the data, Shower A is listed under \"Shower A\" at (1427 - Room 1427) so that's definitely there. Shower B is mentioned as having coordinates (616 - I'm assuming that refers to Room 616), and looking through the waypoints, I don't see a \"Room 616\" listed under any known names. So maybe that's an issue.\n\nWait, in the list of waypoints, there are entries like E5 Entrance at (1535,1535) and others, but no Room 616. So perhaps Shower B is referring to a different room or it's not listed as a waypoint. That might cause a problem because if I can't locate the exact coordinates for Shower B, the action would fail.\n\nSo in this case, taking the user to Shower A should work since that's a valid waypoint at Room 1427. However, trying to take them to Shower B at (616 - I'm not sure) might result in an unknown waypoint. If that's the case, the command would fail because there's no known waypoint matching those coordinates.\n\nTherefore, when executing the actions, the first step is successful, but the second attempt to navigate to Shower B at (616 - ?) will be invalid. Since the supported edge case says if a waypoint is unknown, we need to output an action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nPutting this together, the commands would try to navigate to Shower A first, which works. Then it tries to navigate again to Shower B, but since that's unknown, it will result in a speak action informing the user about the missing waypoint.\n\nSo the final actions should include taking them to Shower A and then trying to go to Shower B, which fails with an error message.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A - Room 1427\",\n        \"x\": 1427,\n        \"y\": 616\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 616,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
