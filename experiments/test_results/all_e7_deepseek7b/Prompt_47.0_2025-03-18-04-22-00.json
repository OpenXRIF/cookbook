    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the commands. The user is asking to go to the E5 Entrance first and then find the Microwaves. So that means two main actions: navigate to E5 and then navigate or do something else with the microwaves. \n\nLooking at the available functions\u2014navigate, speak, and wait\u2014it seems like moving from one place to another would require navigation actions. But I also need to consider if \"find the Microwaves\" involves any speaking commands.\n\nWait, but in the examples provided, when you have a task after an action, it's handled by chaining the actions. So maybe I don't need to do anything else besides navigate twice?\n\nBut hold on, \"find the Microwaves\"\u2014does that require a speak action? Or is it just moving? If the microwaves are in a specific location, perhaps the user needs to navigate there after getting to E5.\n\nI should check if E5 Entrance and Microwaves have known waypoints. From the list provided earlier, I don't see an E5 Entrance listed. So that means I need to output a speak action saying it doesn't exist for the E5 part. But then how do I handle finding the microwaves? Maybe they are in another area.\n\nWait, maybe \"microwave\" is a different waypoint or perhaps it's a building code. Since Microwaves might be represented by something like \"M\" or \"microwave\" as a token.\n\nBut looking at the waypads, there's no E5 Entrance. So first step: navigate to E5 doesn't exist\u2014output speak action. Then for finding microwaves, if it's a known waypoint, perhaps M or something else. If not found either, maybe another speak action.\n\nAlternatively, if \"microwave\" is a building code that should be ignored during navigation, but since we need to find the microwaves after getting to E5, which doesn't exist, so I have to handle both steps appropriately.\n\nSo in this case, since E5 Entrance isn't a valid waypoint, the first action would be to speak that it doesn't exist. Then, for finding microwaves, if it's not another known waypoint, maybe output another speak about the error.\n\nBut wait, how does the system process multiple actions? Do I need to have separate navigate commands or just two speak actions?\n\nHmm, but navigating where isn't possible since E5 doesn't exist. So perhaps after that, we can consider that the second part of the command is invalid as well.\n\nSo overall, my response would be a series of speak actions explaining the issues with both steps.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"E5 Entrance does not exist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Microwaves are unknown or do not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
