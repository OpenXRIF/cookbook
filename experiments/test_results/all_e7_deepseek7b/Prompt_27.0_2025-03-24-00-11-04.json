For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the Elevators. Wait their for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait their for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\" Hmm, first, I should break it down into parts.\n\nThe user is asking to go to the Elevators, wait there for 15 seconds, and then go to the East Entrance. So that sounds like two separate actions: navigating to the Elevators, waiting, and then navigating again to the East Enterence.\n\nWait, but where exactly are these located? From the data given, the Elevators aren't listed as a waypoint directly. The closest is \"E5\" or something else? No, looking back, I see there's no \"Elevators\" waypoint mentioned in the waypoints list provided. So that means if the system doesn't recognize it as a known waypoint, it should return an error.\n\nSo first step: Check if \"Elevators\" exists. Since it's not listed among the available waypoints, the system can't find it. That would trigger the unknown waypoint response, which is to speak and say something like \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the list of waypoints:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n- Room 3202 - Design Team Office\n- Room 4568 - Student Shop\n- Room 9999 - Main Entrance\n- Room 213 - Elevator\nWait, actually, in the data provided earlier, under Starting Locations and Available Functions, there's a waypoint called \"E5\" with coordinates (1834). But looking through the list of waypoints given, I don't see an \"Elevators\" entry. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"E5\" is considered as Elevators? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. No, in the data provided earlier, under the Starting Locations and Available Functions, there's a waypoint called \"E5\" which seems to be a specific location with coordinates (1834). But looking through the list of waypoints given, none are named \"Elevators.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's referring to Room 213 - Elevator? Let me check. Yes, in the initial data provided, under Waypoints:\n\n- Room 213 - Elevator is listed with X=586, Y=49.\n\nSo perhaps the user meant \"Room 213 - Elevator\" as the Elevators. That makes sense because sometimes locations are referred to by their room numbers or specific names.\n\nOkay, so first action: Navigate to Room 213 - Elevator at coordinates (586, 49). Then wait for 15 seconds there. But since waiting isn't a navigation function\u2014wait, the available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So navigating would be moving to the elevator, then waiting is a separate action.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, when they wanted someone to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, it resulted in just one speak action because the unknown zone was unrecognized. But here, if \"Elevators\" refers to Room 213 - Elevator, which exists, then we can proceed.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. The user says: Take me to the Elevators. So navigate to Room 213 - Elevator at (586,49).\n\n2. Then wait there for 15 seconds.\n\n3. Then go to East Entrance. Wait, in the initial data, I don't see an \"East Enterance\" but perhaps it's referring to a waypoint named \"East Entrance.\" But looking back through the list of waypoints provided, I don't see such a waypoint. There is a \"Room 9999 - Main Entrance,\" which might be considered as East Entrance if that's where it leads.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the initial data:\n\nUnder Starting Locations and Available Functions: Waypoints include:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n- Room 3202 - Design Team Office\n- Room 4568 - Student Shop\n- Room 9999 - Main Entrance\n- Room 213 - Elevator\n\nSo East Entrance might be referring to the Main Entrance, which is at X=9999. So after waiting for 15 seconds at the Elevator, the next action would be to navigate to the East Entrance, which is the Main Entrance at (9999,0).\n\nBut wait, in the initial data provided by the user, under Waypoints, there's a waypoint called \"Room 9999 - Main Entrance.\" So perhaps that's considered as the East Entrance. Alternatively, maybe it's another building entrance.\n\nAlternatively, if \"East Enterance\" isn't listed, then it would be unknown. But in this case, I think \"Main Entrance\" is more likely referred to as the East Entrance since it's probably at a northern or eastern part of the building.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst action: Navigating to Room 213 - Elevator (586,49).\n\nSecond action: Waiting for 15 seconds there.\n\nThird action: Navigating to Main Entrance (9999,0), which is likely considered as the East Entrance.\n\nWait, but in the initial available functions and waypoints provided by the user, he listed:\n\nWaypoints:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n- Room 3202 - Design Team Office\n- Room 4568 - Student Shop\n- Room 9999 - Main Entrance\n- Room 213 - Elevator\n\nSo if the user refers to \"East Enterance\" as \"Main Entrance,\" which is at (9999,0), then it's a known waypoint.\n\nTherefore, the actions would be:\n\n1. Take the user to Room 213 - Elevator (586,49).\n\n2. Wait there for 15 seconds.\n\n3. Then go to Main Entrance (9999,0).\n\nBut wait, can you have sequential actions of navigate and wait? Or does waiting require a separate action?\n\nIn the example given earlier when dealing with an unknown zone, it resulted in just one speak action because both parts were unknown. But here, two parts are known: Elevator is Room 213 - Elevator, so that's known.\n\nWait, but if \"Elevators\" is not a waypoint and the user meant Room 213 - Elevator as the first destination, then yes, it's known. So:\n\nFirst action: Navigate to Room 213 - Elevator at (586,49).\n\nSecond action: Wait for 15 seconds.\n\nThird action: Navigates to Main Entrance (9999,0), which is considered East Entrance.\n\nBut the way the user phrased it was a bit ambiguous. They said \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait their for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\"\n\nSo perhaps it's:\n\n- Go to Elevators (which is Room 213 - Elevator).\n\n- Wait there for 15 seconds.\n\n- Then go to East Entrance (Main Entrance).\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"East Entrance\" refers to a different waypoint or just the Main Entrance. Given that, in the data provided, it's listed as Room 9999 - Main Entrance, so likely that is considered as East Entrance.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n1. Navigates to Room 213 - Elevator at (586,49).\n\n2. Waits for 15 seconds there.\n\n3. Then navigates to Room 9999 - Main Entrance.\n\nBut wait, the initial way I thought is that if both Elevators and East Entrance are known, then it's possible. But in reality, does the elevator refer to a different building? Or is it part of the same building?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Elevators\" refers to an existing building entrance, but from the data provided, only Main Entrance exists as 9999.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to clarify that the user meant Room 213 - Elevator for the first destination and East Entrance for the second. So both are known waypoints.\n\nTherefore, in terms of actions:\n\n- First action: navigate to (586,49) which is Room 213 - Elevator.\n\n- Second action: wait there for 15 seconds.\n\n- Third action: navigate again to (9999,0), East Entrance.\n\nBut the problem is that in the initial data provided by the user, under Waypoints, only four are listed besides Main Entrance. So if \"Elevators\" refers to an existing building's elevator, perhaps not a waypoint but a location within the building. Hmm, no, because waypoints are specific locations with coordinates.\n\nWait, actually, in the starting locations and available functions, it says:\n\nStarting Location: X=1834, Y=2017\n\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, wait\n\nWaypoints listed include:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n- Room 3202 - Design Team Office\n- Room 4568 - Student Shop\n- Room 9999 - Main Entrance\n- Room 213 - Elevator\n\nSo in this context, \"Elevators\" could be referring to the building's elevator, which might not have a waypoint. But according to the data provided earlier, under Waypoints, there is a waypoint called \"Room 213 - Elevator.\" So perhaps the user meant that as their first destination.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\n1. Navigates to Room 213 - Elevator (586,49).\n\n2. Waits for 15 seconds.\n\n3. Then navigates again to Main Entrance (9999,0), which is East Entrance.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"Take me to the Elevators,\" so maybe it's not necessarily a waypoint but rather using an elevator in the building. However, from the data provided earlier, there are no waypoints related to elevators or any other parts of the building besides those listed.\n\nWait, hold on. The starting location is (1834,2017), and available functions include navigate, speak, wait.\n\nWaypoints:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n\nSo maybe these are all the waypoints in this context, meaning that the user can only go to those specific room numbers or Main Entrance. Therefore, \"Elevators\" might not be a waypoint but perhaps an area within one of these rooms.\n\nWait, but unless there's a waypoint related to elevators, which isn't listed here except for Room 213 - Elevator, so maybe the user is confused and referring to that as the first destination.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to assume:\n\nFirst action: navigate to (586,49) which is Room 213 - Elevator.\n\nSecond action: wait there for 15 seconds.\n\nThird action: then go to (9999,0), East Entrance.\n\nBut given the data provided by the user, these are all known waypoints. Therefore, it's possible to plan this out step-by-step.\n</think>\n\nTo address the request of navigating through the building as described:\n\n1. **Navigate to Room 213 - Elevator** at coordinates (586, 49).\n2. **Wait for 15 seconds** in that room.\n3. **Proceed to the Main Entrance**, which is considered East Entrance with coordinates (9999, 0).\n\nThis sequence of actions will fulfill each part of the request systematically.",
