For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Enterance?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The user says, \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\" Hmm, first, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I should check if there are any unknown waypoints here. The user mentions \"Microwaves\" and \"E5 Entrance.\" Looking through the list of waypoints provided earlier, I don't see a \"Microwaves\" waypoint. Wait, maybe they meant \"Microwave\"? Or perhaps \"Microwave\" is another name for something else? Hmm, no, in the waypoints listed, there's \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"RoboHub,\" and so on, but not \"Microwaves.\" So I think \"Microwaves\" isn't a known waypoint.\n\nNext, looking at the target waypoint, \"E5 Entrance.\" Is that one of the known waypoints? Scanning through the list... Yes! There's an E5 Entrance with coordinates (1535, 1535). That should be our target.\n\nNow, processing the command: starting from \"Microwaves,\" guide back to \"E5 Entrance.\" Since we've established that \"Microwaves\" isn't a known waypoint, this part is tricky. In the handling complex commands section, it says if multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. So maybe interpreting \"Microwaves\" as an unknown waypoint and then guiding to E5 Entrance makes sense.\n\nSo, first step: Since \"Microwaves\" isn't a known waypoint, output a speak action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nSecond step: Then navigate from the starting location (0,0) to \"E5 Entrance\" at (1535, 1535).\n\nWait, but maybe I should handle this in one go. Since starting locations are given as (0,0), perhaps if there's an unknown waypoint, we can't proceed further without it being defined. Therefore, the first action is to speak that \"Microwaves\" doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant another waypoint? But since I don't have additional context, I'll stick with the given information.\n\nSo in terms of actions:\n\n1. Speak because \"Microwaves\" isn't found.\n2. Then navigate to E5 Entrance from (0,0).\n\nWait, but the prompt says starting at Microwaves and then guiding back to E5 Entrance. But since Microwaves doesn't exist, we can't perform any action from there. So perhaps the correct sequence is just to guide directly from start to E5 Entrance.\n\nBut according to the handling complex commands, if multiple interpretations minimize backtracking, maybe it's better to interpret \"starting at\" as starting point being Microwaves but since that doesn't exist, then navigate directly to E5 Entrance.\n\nSo first action: speak because Microwaves is unknown. Then second action: navigate from 0,0 to E5 Entrance.\n\nBut the example given in the prompt shows that if waypoints are known, you can guide back between them. But here, since starting point is unknown, maybe we can only guide from start point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"starting at\" implies moving to a known waypoint, but since Microwaves isn't known, it's an error.\n\nHmm, according to the supported edge cases, if any waypoint is unknown, return actions with speak stating it doesn't exist. So in this case, starting at Microwaves would require that action first.\n\nSo, final plan:\n\n1. Speak: \"This waypoint does not exist\" for \"Microwaves.\"\n\n2. Then navigate from 0,0 to E5 Entrance.\n\nWait, but the user said \"can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\" So if starting at an unknown point, it's unclear where to start guiding. Maybe in that case, we should just go directly to E5 Entrance without needing a starting point since Microwaves isn't known.\n\nSo perhaps only one action: navigate from 0,0 to E5 Entrance.\n\nBut the prompt says \"starting at the Microwaves,\" which might imply moving there first, but if it's unknown, that's not possible. So maybe we can ignore that part and just go directly.\n\nAlternatively, since starting locations are provided as (0,0), perhaps any waypoint navigation should start from there unless specified otherwise. But in this case, the user is trying to guide back to E5 Entrance, which would require knowing where they are currently located.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but following the rules: if the starting point is unknown, and waypoints are known only if explicitly listed, then probably we should navigate directly from (0,0) to E5 Entrance without considering Microwaves since it's not recognized.\n\nBut maybe interpreting \"starting at theMicrowaves\" as needing to first move there before guiding back. Since that waypoint isn't known, perhaps the command is invalid and only navigation from start applies.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct approach is:\n\n- First action: Speak because Microwaves doesn't exist.\n- Second action: Navigate to E5 Entrance from (0,0).\n\nBut looking at the user's exact wording: \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\" So perhaps it implies moving from current position to E5 Entrance. But if starting point is unknown, maybe it's an error.\n\nAlternatively, since we're given a starting location (0,0), perhaps we should ignore the starting at Microwaves part because that's not possible and just navigate directly to E5 Entrance.\n\nBut according to the handling complex commands section: \"If multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking.\" So in this case, moving from unknown (Microwaves) is problematic. Maybe it's better to ignore the starting point if Microwaves isn't known and just navigate directly to E5 Entrance.\n\nSo perhaps only one action: navigate from 0,0 to E5 Entrance at (1535,1535).\n\nWait, but how? Because without a current position, guiding back is impossible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"starting at Microwaves\" implies that the user wants to start there and then go somewhere else. But since Microwaves isn't known, this command can't be processed correctly. So perhaps it's better to just guide directly from (0,0) to E5 Entrance.\n\nIn conclusion, I think:\n\n1. Speak: \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\n2. Then navigate to E5 Entrance at (1535, 1535).\n\nBut since the starting location is given as (0,0), perhaps we can just do that directly without needing to move from Microwaves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a waypoint called \"Microwaves\" but it's not listed here. So in this case, I have to go with what's provided.\n\nSo final actions:\n\n1. Speak: \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\n2. Then navigate to E5 Entrance at (1535, 1535) from the current location, which is unknown but perhaps starts at (0,0).\n\nBut since starting point isn't specified beyond (0,0), I'll assume it's okay.\n\nSo in terms of action steps:\n\n- First, output a speak because Microwaves doesn't exist.\n\n- Then output navigate to E5 Entrance from (0,0).\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Waypoints:**\n   - \"Microwave\" is not listed as a known waypoint.\n   - \"E5 Entrance\" exists with coordinates (1535, 1535).\n\n2. **Process the Command:**\n   - The command starts at an unknown waypoint (\"Microwaves\"), which doesn't exist.\n   - The target is to navigate back to \"E5 Entrance.\"\n\n3. **Handle Unknown Waypoints:**\n   - Since \"Microwaves\" isn't recognized, output a speak action indicating its absence.\n\n4. **Navigate to the Known Waypoint:**\n   - Start from the given starting location (0, 0).\n   - Directly navigate to \"E5 Entrance\" at (1535, 1535).\n\n**Final Actions:**\n\n- Action 1: Speak: \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n- Action 2: Navigate to E5 Entrance at coordinates (1535, 1535).",
