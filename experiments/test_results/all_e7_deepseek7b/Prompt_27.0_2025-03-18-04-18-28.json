    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait their for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into parts. It seems like there are two main actions here: navigating to a specific location called the Elevators and waiting there for a certain amount of time before moving on to another place.\n\nLooking at the supported functions, I know that \"navigate\" is available along with \"wait\". The user also mentioned an \"East Enterance\", which probably refers to the East Entrance. \n\nSo the first step would be to navigate to the Elevators. But wait, in our list of waypoints, do we have a location named \"Elevators\"? Scanning through the provided waypoints, I don't see one. The closest is \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and others like \"RoboHub Entrance\". Since there's no known waypoint for Elevators, according to the edge cases mentioned, if an unknown waypoint is requested, we have to return a speak action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, the user isn't directly asking to go to the Elevators; they're telling us to take them. Hmm. Maybe \"Elevators\" refers to the name of a building or area, but without a specific waypoint listed, I can't navigate there. So perhaps this part is unknown and should trigger an error.\n\nMoving on to the next instruction: wait their for 15 seconds. Again, there's no known waypoint called \"their\". Since waypoints like Elevators are unknown, it seems we can't fulfill this part either.\n\nFinally, they want us to find the East Enterance. Looking at our list, I don't see a specific East Entrance. The closest is \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" and other entrances named \"RoboHub\", \"East Enterance\" isn't listed. So again, this would be an unknown waypoint.\n\nPutting it all together, since each part refers to unknown waypoints or commands that aren't supported (like using \"their\"), the appropriate response is to return a speak action indicating invalid requests.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Elevators' and 'their' are not valid waypoints\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
