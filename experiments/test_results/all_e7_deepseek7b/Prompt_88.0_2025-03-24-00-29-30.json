For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 88.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into parts. The user is telling a robot to do something. So, maybe I should interpret this as a navigate action where the name of the waypoint is 'Silent Study' with coordinates (0,0). But wait, looking back at the waypoints provided, there's no Silent Study mentioned. So, that means it's an unknown waypoint.\n\nIf the waypoint doesn't exist, according to the instructions, I should output actions that include a speak action saying the waypoint doesn't exist and then proceed as per the command. The example given in the problem statement includes using 'speak' when the waypoint is unknown.\n\nAlso, since the user mentioned \"wait for 10 minutes,\" but the supported edge cases only mention waiting with specific durations if it's part of a navigate action or not at all. However, without a corresponding navigate command to a waypoint named Silent Study, I can't execute any navigation actions. So, I should just return an error message.\n\nPutting this together, the response should be that 'Silent Study' is unknown and then mention waiting for 10 minutes as per the instruction.\n</think>\n\nThe user's prompt involves navigating to \"Silent Study\" but it doesn't exist in the available waypoints.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Waypoint**: The user mentions \"Silent Study.\" However, reviewing the list of waypoints, this specific waypoint is not present.\n\n2. **Handle Unknown Waypoints**: Since \"Silent Study\" isn't listed, it falls under the category of an unknown waypoint.\n\n3. **Output the Appropriate Response**: According to the guidelines, for any unknown waypoint, a speak action is used to inform that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\n4. **Process the Remainder of the Command**: The user also mentions waiting for 10 minutes, but since there's no corresponding navigate command, this instruction isn't actionable in the current context.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
