For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\"\n",

    "Prompt ID": 10.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says, \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, from the provided data, there are several waypoints listed like C&D areas, RoboHub, Ideas Clinic, etc., but I don't see a waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" So, that might be an unknown area. The user mentions starting at the Microwaves and then wants to go back to the E5 Entrance.\n\nSince \"Microwaves\" isn't listed among the known waypoints, according to the instructions, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, I should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and explain that the waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, maybe there's another way around it. Let me check if \"Microwaves\" could be a typo or misinterpretation.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, none are named \"Microwaves,\" so I think it's safe to assume it's unknown. Then, since E5 Entrance is listed under known waypoints (E5 Entrance has its details). So perhaps the user meant to go back from somewhere else to the E5 Entrance.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if a waypoint is unknown, output an action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" But in this case, maybe I should also check if there's another interpretation. Maybe the user is referring to a different area that includes Microwaves as part of it? But since no such waypoint exists, perhaps just treat \"Microwaves\" as unknown.\n\nBut wait, the example given when an unknown waypoint is encountered returns an action where they speak and say the waypoint doesn't exist. So in this case, starting at the Microwaves is a waypoint that doesn't exist, so the initial step would be to respond that it's unknown. However, the user then asks to guide back to E5 Entrance.\n\nSo perhaps I need to first address the starting point. Since \"Microwaves\" isn't known, we can't start there. Therefore, maybe we should return an error or instruction about the unknown waypoint before trying to navigate elsewhere.\n\nBut looking at the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, output that it doesn't exist with the speak action. However, in this case, the user seems to have two steps: starting at Microwaves (unknown) and then moving back to E5 Entrance. But since you can't start at an unknown location, perhaps we need to handle this by first addressing the unknown waypoint.\n\nSo, maybe the response should include a speak action indicating that the starting point is unknown, which would prevent any further navigation from there.\n\nBut wait, according to the handling of complex commands, if multiple steps are involved and one step fails, the command might be aborted. So perhaps in this case, since starting at Microwaves is invalid, we can't proceed with guiding back to E5 Entrance either. Therefore, maybe the entire command should result in a speak action with an error message.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Microwaves\" isn't known but refers to another waypoint indirectly, I might need more context. But from the data provided, there's no such waypoint. So it's safe to assume that both steps are invalid because the starting point is unknown.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response would be a single speak action with an error message indicating the request is invalid due to the unknown waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Microwaves' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
