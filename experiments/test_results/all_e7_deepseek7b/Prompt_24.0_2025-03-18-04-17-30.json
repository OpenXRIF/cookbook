    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this user prompt that says, \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study's.\" My task is to figure out what action sequence the AI should take. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's intent here. They want the AI to navigate to RoboHub first and then go to the Silent Study. The prompt doesn't mention any waypoints that we have predefined, so I might need to check if \"RoboHub\" is a known waypoint or if it's an unknown one.\n\nLooking at the provided waypoints list, I don't see any entry for RoboHub or Silent Study's. That means both of these are unknown waypoints. According to the guidelines under Handling Unknown Waypoints, when an unknown waypoint is requested, the AI should return an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input stating that the waypoint does not exist.\n\nBut wait, there's also a note about handling complex commands. The user's command involves multiple steps: first moving to RoboHub, then proceeding to the Silent Study. If both are unknown, what happens? Do I treat each as an individual unknown waypoint or combine them?\n\nLooking back at the examples provided, when dealing with unknown waypoints in a sequence, it seems that if any part of the command is unknown, the entire action might be considered invalid or ambiguous. In Example 3, where \"unknown zone\" was mentioned, the AI responded with a speak action.\n\nSo, applying this logic here, since both waypoints are unknown, the AI should respond by speaking to inform the user that both places do not exist. But how does it handle two unknowns in sequence? The guidelines don't specify handling multiple unknowns separately but rather treat the entire command as invalid if any waypoint is unknown.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response would be a single speak action informing the user about both waypoints being unknown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'RoboHub' and 'Silent Study's' are not valid waypoints\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
