For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room.\"\n",

    "Data Set": "E7-1",
    "Experiment ID": 3.0,
    "Prompt ID": 19.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: \"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the command. It seems like there are two main actions here: navigating to the Ideas Clinic and then moving to the Assembly Room. The user wants to perform both in sequence, so they probably want me to first go to one place and then proceed to another without any issues.\n\nLooking at the supported functions, it's \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" and \"wait.\" But in this case, there are no commands that require speaking or waiting; it's purely about navigation. So I can ignore those unless needed for something else.\n\nNow, I need to check if both waypoints exist. The first waypoint is Ideas Clinic. Let me look through the list of waypoints provided:\n\nI see several entries like Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic with specific coordinates. So yes, Ideas Clinic exists at (x: 25, y: 75). That should be straightforward.\n\nThe second part is going to the Assembly Room. I'll check if that's a known waypoint. Scanning through the list again... Hmm, there's E5 Entrance but not Assembly Room. I don't see any entry for Assembly Room in the provided data. So this might be an unknown zone.\n\nIf both waypoints exist, then the command would work fine. But since the second one is unknown, according to the edge cases, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I need to output a speak action saying it's invalid.\n\nSo putting it all together: First navigate to Ideas Clinic at (25,75). Then attempt to go to Assembly Room, which doesn't exist. Since one of them is missing, the entire command would fail because the second part can't be completed. But wait, does the system handle partial commands or just ignore unknown parts?\n\nLooking back at the examples, when a waypoint was unknown, it resulted in an action that spoke with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" However, if there are multiple steps and one is missing, should I execute the first step and then fail? Or skip the second step because the first failed?\n\nI think each navigate command would be treated as separate actions. So first, try to go to Ideas Clinic: that's successful. Then attempt to go to Assembly Room: since it doesn't exist, return an error. But in terms of actions, do I output both steps? Or just stop after the first failure.\n\nBut according to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, you get \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So when moving to the second part, which is unknown, should it trigger that response as well?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each navigate action would result in an error. But I think since the user provided two waypoints and only one exists, perhaps both steps are attempted but only the first succeeds.\n\nWait, no: if you parse the command into actions, each \"navigate\" is a separate action. So the first navigate to Ideas Clinic is fine. Then the second navigate to Assembly Room would fail because it's unknown. But in terms of the API response, I have to return an array of actions for each step.\n\nSo in this case, my output should be:\n\nFirst action: navigate to Ideas Clinic at (25,75). That's valid.\nSecond action: try to navigate to Assembly Room but since it doesn't exist, return \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nBut according to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, the function returns an array with that action. So in this case, would both actions be included? The first being successful and the second failing.\n\nI think yes: each navigate command is processed separately. So I need to include both steps in the actions array, but for the second one, it's an invalid waypoint.\n\nBut wait, let me check the supported edge cases again: if a waypoint is unknown, return that action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" But here, there are two navigate commands. Should each of them be output as actions?\n\nYes, because they're separate steps in the command. So first, go to Ideas Clinic successfully; then attempt to go to Assembly Room which fails.\n\nSo the response would have two actions: one successful and one with an error message about the unknown waypoint.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about whether each navigate is treated as an individual action regardless of success or failure. Looking at the examples provided, when there was an unknown zone in the command, it resulted in a single speak action saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\" However, that seems to be for a single step.\n\nIn our case, since there are two steps, and one is invalid, I think both should be processed as separate actions. So first, navigate to Ideas Clinic at (25,75), which exists. Then attempt to navigate to Assembly Room at some coordinates, but it's unknown. Therefore, the second action would return an error.\n\nBut in the command, there are no coordinates specified for Assembly Room, so I assume any invalid or non-existent waypoint would be triggered.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's command \"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room,\" we first check if both waypoints exist:\n\n1. **Ideas Clinic**: Exists at (x: 25, y: 75).\n2. **Assembly Room**: Does not exist in the provided data.\n\nThe response should include two actions:\n- A successful navigate action to Ideas Clinic.\n- An action indicating that Assembly Room does not exist.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Parse the command into individual actions.\n2. Verify each waypoint's existence.\n3. Output a valid navigate action for Ideas Clinic.\n4. Return an error message for Assembly Room since it doesn't exist.\n\n**Final Response:**\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"function\": \"navigate\",\n    \"coordinates\": { \"x\": 25, \"y\": 75 }\n  },\n  {\n    \"function\": \"speak\",\n    \"message\": \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
