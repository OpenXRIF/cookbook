For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command step by step. The prompt is quite detailed, so let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the user wants me to start at E5 Entrance and begin a security patrol. From the available functions, I know I can navigate. So my first action should be to move to E5 Entrance. Looking at the waypoints, E5 Entrance has coordinates (1834, 0). Wait, no, actually, the starting locations are X:0, Y:0, so I need to navigate there.\n\nNext, after completing the patrol, I need to go to Temporary Booth. Checking the waypoint names, \"Temporary Booth\" is listed under E5 Entrance as (1834, 0). But I already navigated there first. So maybe it's a different entrance? Wait, no, in the list of waypoints, E5 Entrance has multiple mentions but perhaps the correct one for Temporary Booth is at X:1826, Y: -4, which is labeled as \"Student Shop\" under E5 Entrance. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nWait, looking back, E5 Entrance (X:1834) and Student Shop (X:1834, Y:-4). But the user mentions Temporary Booth at X: 1826, Y:-4. So perhaps I need to go from E5 Entrance (0,0) to E5 Entrance waypoint at (1834,0), then navigate to Temporary Booth which might be a different location? Or is it part of E5?\n\nWait, no, in the list under E5 Entrance, there's a waypoint named \"Student Shop\" with X:1834, Y:-4. But I'm supposed to go to Temporary Booth at X:1826, Y:-4, which isn't directly listed as an E5 Entrance waypoint.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the user meant to refer to E5 Entrance's Temporary Booth. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the waypoint names. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the waypoints:\n\n- Student Shop: X=1834, Y=-4\n- E5 Entrance: X=1834\n\nBut the user refers to \"Temporary Booth\" at X=1826, Y=-4. That doesn't match any waypoint in E5 Entrance or elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nUnder E5 Entrance:\n{\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Student Shop\",\n    \"x\": 1834,\n    \"y\": -4\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n    \"x\": 1834,\n    \"y\": 0\n  }\n}\n\nSo, no waypoint named Temporary Booth. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake, referring to a non-existent waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Temporary Booth\" is another name for E5 Entrance or Student Shop? No, that doesn't make sense. So I think the correct approach is to respond with an unknown waypoint error because there's no way to navigate to Temporary Booth from E5 Entrance without more information.\n\nSo my response should inform the user about this issue.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Temporary Booth' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
