For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"I could really go for a shower.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned wanting a shower. From the list of waypoints provided, there are two showers: Shower A at 951.0, 616.0 and Shower A again? Wait, no, actually looking back, I see only Shower A is listed once at 951.0, 616.0 with tokens \"Clean\" and \"Wash\". Then there's another Shower A maybe? Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the waypoint list under 'Shower' category, I see:\n\n- Shower A: X=951, Y=616\n- Shower B: Not listed\n\nNo, actually, looking back at the initial list, it seems only Shower A is present. So perhaps there's a mistake because both are named Shower A? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, no. Looking again:\n\nIn the wayfarer's list under 'Shower' category:\n\n- Shower A: X=951, Y=616\n- Shower B: Not listed\n\nSo only one shower is present. So, the user mentioned a shower but perhaps meant to refer to a specific one.\n\nBut in our waypoints, there are two showers?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the waypoint list provided by the user:\n\nShower A: X=951, Y=616\n\nNo other showers listed. So maybe the user is referring to this one.\n\nSo, for the prompt \"I could really go for a shower,\" I need to navigate to the shower location.\n\nThe starting position is at 827.0, 610.0.\n\nSo the function would be 'navigate' with input name being Shower A and coordinates X=951, Y=616.\n\nTherefore, the action should be:\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A\",\n        \"x\": 951,\n        \"y\": 616\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A\",\n        \"x\": 951,\n        \"y\": 616\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
