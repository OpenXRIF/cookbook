    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this user prompt step by step. The prompt says: \"Robot, proceed to [[Elevators]], say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation, and wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\"\n\nFirst off, I need to parse the commands here. It looks like there are two main instructions. The first is about proceeding to a specific location called [[Elevators]], which probably corresponds to an elevator area in the game or building. Then, when at that location, the user should say \"Elevators\" for assistance with navigation.\n\nThe second part of the prompt says to wait for 5 minutes before moving on. So after dealing with the elevators, they need to wait a bit and then proceed further.\n\nNow, checking the supported commands: navigate, speak, and wait. The first action is to navigate to [[Elevators]], which should be straightforward using the \"navigate\" function. Then, at that location, the user needs to perform an action of speaking by saying \"Elevators\". Finally, they have to wait for 5 minutes.\n\nI need to structure this into a JSON output with actions in order. So first navigate to [[Elevators]], then speak \"Elevators\", and then wait for 5 seconds (since the prompt says 5 minutes but I think it's meant to be seconds; maybe that was a typo). \n\nWait, no, actually, in the examples provided, when waiting for a certain duration, they used numerical values without specifying units. So perhaps \"wait for 5\" would mean 5 seconds or just an integer number of steps.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'll have three actions: navigate to [[Elevators]], speak \"Elevators\", and wait for 5. That should cover the user's instructions properly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"[[Elevators]]\",\n        \"x\": null,\n        \"y\": null\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Elevators\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 5\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
