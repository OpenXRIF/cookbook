Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there are known waypoints for both locations mentioned in the prompt. From the data provided, there's a waypoint called \"Ideas Clinic\" with coordinates (100, 50) and an \"Assembly Room\" at (200, 80). \n\nNext, I need to process the command. The user wants me to navigate to the Ideas Clinic first. So, I'll create an action to move there, specifying its name, x, and y coordinates.\n\nAfter reaching the Ideas Clinic, the next step is to go to the Assembly Room. Since navigation actions can be chained without needing intermediate steps, I can add another navigate action pointing directly to the Assembly Room's location.\n\nI don't need any additional actions like speak or wait because the command only involves moving between two known waypoints without any stops in between.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 50\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": 200,\n        \"y\": 80\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
