    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user provided an example prompt where they want to take someone to Shower A, then shower B for a minute, and after that, proceed further.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the available waypoints. Looking at the list, there are several showers mentioned: Shower A, Shower B, and maybe others. But in this case, only Shower A and Shower B are specified in the prompt.\n\nNext, according to the fuzzy matching rules, if a waypoint is unknown or not found, we should return an action to speak with an appropriate message. However, since both shower areas exist based on the provided data (Shower A at coordinates 807,610 and Shower B at 827,610), they are known waypoints.\n\nSo, applying the normalization step: convert everything to lowercase. The user's input becomes \"i need to freshen up take me to shower a then shower b wait 1 minute at shower b then we can go\".\n\nThen, remove extraneous tokens that might represent codes or non-essential parts. For example, if there are any numbers attached as part of the name, but in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nTokenization: split into individual words. The user's input becomes [\"i\", \"need\", \"to\", \"freshen\", \"up\", \"take\", \"me\", \"to\", \"shower\", \"a\", \"then\", \"shower\", \"b\", \"wait\", \"1\", \"minute\", \"at\", \"shower\", \"b\", \"then\", \"we\", \"can\", \"go\"].\n\nNow, checking each known waypoint's tokens against the user's input. Both Shower A and Shower B are in the list. However, since the user is asking for a sequence (Shower A then shower B), we can infer that they want to navigate to both in order.\n\nSo, first action is to navigate to Shower A at its coordinates. Then, after reaching there, perform an action to wait 1 minute at Shower B's location. Finally, proceed further as per the instructions.\n\nI need to structure this into actions: first navigate to Shower A, then speak or do something at Shower B for a minute, and then maybe navigate again if needed. But based on the example given in the prompt, it seems after waiting, they can go further without needing another action unless specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A\",\n        \"x\": 807,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 1\n      // Wait for 1 minute at Shower B before proceeding further.\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      // Depending on the output from the previous actions, proceed accordingly.
