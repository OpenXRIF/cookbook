    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the available waypoints. From the data provided, I see that there are several named like Ideas Clinic, RoboHub Entrance, C&D Coffee Area, etc., but nothing exactly called \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nLooking through each waypoint:\n\n- E7 isn't listed as a standalone name. There might be other areas or parts of names with numbers and letters, but none match exactly.\n- The terms \"silent study\" don't appear in any known waypoints either.\n\nSo, since there's no exact match for \"E7 silent study,\" I have to handle this according to the instructions given. \n\nThe user is asking me to navigate somewhere that isn't on the list. According to the handling complex commands section, if a waypoint isn't found, I should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input stating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, I need to construct an appropriate response. The example given in the unknown waypoint case was: \n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nI should follow that structure because it clearly communicates the issue and provides a helpful message.\n\nSo, my action will be to create an array with one speak action. The input string should inform the user that \"E7 silent study\" isn't recognized.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll format it as per the required JSON structure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Sorry, E7 silent study is not a known waypoint.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
