    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user has instructed the robot to move to the Assembly Room, perform an action there called \"state 'Assembly Room'\", and then wait for confirmation before moving on.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the command correctly. It seems like two main actions are required: navigating to the Assembly Room and waiting after that. However, the mention of performing a state upon arrival adds another layer. \n\nI recall that according to the handling complex commands section, we should process them in order unless told otherwise. So, moving to the Assembly Room first makes sense. Once there, the robot needs to perform an action called \"state 'Assembly Room'\". I'm not entirely sure what this action entails\u2014maybe it's some confirmation or status update. \n\nAfter performing that state action, the robot should wait for confirmation before proceeding further. So, the sequence would be navigate to Assembly Room, then perform the state action, and finally wait.\n\nNow, checking if these actions are supported by our available functions: Navigate is \"speak\" with a waypoints input, State isn't directly mentioned in the supported actions (which only include navigate, speak, and wait). So using \"speak\" for the state command might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps we can map the state action to \"wait\", but that doesn't fit well.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The functions are specifically \"navigate\", \"speak\", and \"wait\". Since \"state\" isn't a function here, using \"speak\" for it would technically work but might not convey the intended action accurately. Alternatively, if \"state\" is supposed to be another navigate action with waypoints specified by some code or token, that's possible too.\n\nBut given our current functions don't include \"state\", I think we have to proceed with \"speak\". So each part of the command would translate into a speak action with the appropriate input. \n\nPutting it all together:\n1. Navigate to Assembly Room.\n2. Speak (use \"speak\" function) for state 'Assembly Room'.\n3. Wait for confirmation.\n\nThis way, even though \"state\" isn't a direct function, we can use \"speak\" as an approximation based on the available commands.\n\nI should also check if the waypoints exist and have correct coordinates. Assuming they do, the robot can execute these actions in sequence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": ...,\n        \"y\": ...\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"State 'Assembly Room'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": confirmation_time\n    }\n  ]\n}",
