    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt. The prompt says, \"Robot, go to [[Silent Study]], say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice, and wait for 15 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the robot needs to do step by step. It seems like there are two main actions: moving to the Silent Study area and then waiting for 15 minutes.\n\nLooking at the available functions, the robot can navigate, speak, or wait. So, \"navigate\" would be used to go to the location, \"speak\" to say the name in a calm voice, and \"wait\" for 15 minutes.\n\nI notice that the user included [[Silent Study]] in their command. I need to determine if this is a valid waypoint. From the list provided earlier, there's no entry called Silent Study or anything similar like that. The closest is the Coffee Area (C&D) and areas with numbers but not letters. So, [[Silent Study]] doesn't match any known waypoint.\n\nAccording to the handling complex commands section, if multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. In this case, since Silent Study isn't a valid waypoint, it's probably best to treat the entire command as invalid because moving there is impossible.\n\nSo, the robot should respond with an action that acknowledges the unknown waypoint and perhaps requests clarification or assistance.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response would be to use the \"speak\" function with the message that Silent Study isn't a valid location. This way, it's clear that the command can't be completed as requested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Silent Study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
