For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Take my to the HubRobo\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Take my to the HubRobo.\" Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the user is asking. The phrase seems a bit off, maybe there's a typo. It could be trying to say something like taking something to HubRobo, but that doesn't make much sense as a waypoint name. Let me check if \"HubRobo\" matches any of the known waypoints.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints provided:\n\n- C&D areas have various Coffee Area, Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic, etc.\n- E5 Entrance and Student Shop are in South Side.\n- RoboHub is a specific spot, but I don't see \"RoboHub\" as a waypoint name. The closest is \"RoboHub\" itself, maybe? Wait, no, the waypoint is just called RoboHub without any suffix.\n\nWait, actually, there's a waypoint named RoboHub with coordinates X=25, Y=75. So the user might be trying to navigate to that point. But in their prompt, they wrote \"HubRobo,\" which would imply swapping letters, but I don't think that's correct. The correct name is RoboHub.\n\nSo assuming it's a typo and the intended waypoint is RoboHub, then yes, there is such a waypoint. Therefore, the user wants to navigate to RoboHub.\n\nNext, according to the handling of complex commands, if multiple steps are involved, we process them left-to-right unless told otherwise. But in this case, it's just a single command: navigating to HubRobo, assuming the typo is corrected.\n\nSo the function \"navigate\" would be used with the input specifying RoboHub as the name and the given X=25, Y=75 coordinates.\n\nI should make sure that the navigation action is correctly formatted. The action object should have \"navigate\" with an input object containing \"name,\" \"x,\" and \"y.\" So the final output would be an array with one action: navigate to RoboHub at those coordinates.\n</think>\n\nThe user's intent is to navigate to HubRobo, which I assume they meant RoboHub based on the provided waypoints.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
