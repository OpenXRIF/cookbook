For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 47.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break it down into steps. It looks like there are two main actions: going to the E5 Entrance and then finding the Microwaves.\n\nI remember from the examples that when a command has multiple steps, the actions should be output in order. So first, navigate to the E5 Entrance, then do something after arriving there.\n\nNow, I need to check if \"Microwaves\" is a known waypoint. Looking through the list of waypoints provided, I don't see any named Microwaves. There are places like C&D Coffee Area or RoboHub, but nothing that fits a Microwave. So, it's probably an unknown waypoint.\n\nAccording to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, we should return an action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" But since there are two steps, do I need to handle both? Or just note that one of them doesn't exist?\n\nWait, in the first example prompt, when it was an unknown zone followed by another step, they returned a single speak action saying it's invalid. So maybe if any part is unknown, the entire command is considered invalid.\n\nBut looking again, the second step isn't exactly asking for a waypoint named Microwaves; it's more about finding something once there. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user says to \"find the Microwaves,\" which might mean they are referring to a specific location that doesn't exist as a waypoint.\n\nSo perhaps both actions need to be processed, but since one is unknown, maybe only the first action can be performed before hitting an unknown step.\n\nBut according to the example given for an invalid request like 'unknown zone', the response was to speak about it. So in this case, traveling to E5 Entrance and then finding the Microwaves might involve two steps: navigating to E5 (which is a known waypoint) and then attempting to find something else that's unknown.\n\nBut since the user didn't specify what exactly they're looking for beyond \"Microwaves,\" maybe it's just an unknown waypoint. So, after arriving at E5, the next step can't be completed because there's no Microwaves waypoint defined.\n\nTherefore, I should output an action to speak about the second part being invalid.\n\nSo putting it together, first navigate to E5 Entrance and then mention that finding the Microwaves is not possible. But since commands need to be in order, maybe both actions are needed but with a fallback speak action for the unknown part.\n\nWait, no\u2014since the prompt says \"then find the Microwaves,\" I think it implies two separate actions: first navigate to E5, then attempt to go somewhere else (which is invalid). So perhaps the second step can't be completed because there's no waypoint named Microwaves.\n\nSo, in terms of actions, first move to E5 Entrance and then try to find the Microwaves. Since Microwaves isn't a known waypoint, it should trigger an error message.\n\nBut according to the handling complex commands section, if multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. So perhaps the main action is navigating to E5 Entrance and then trying to go to a non-existent place, leading to a speak action about it not existing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just outputting an error for the second step after arriving at E5.\n\nI'm a bit confused on whether both steps need actions or just one. But following the example where a single unknown zone leads to a single speak action, perhaps this case should also result in speaking about the Microwaves not existing.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the prompt \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves,\" we will break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Navigate to the E5 Entrance**: This is a known waypoint.\n\n2. **Find the Microwaves**: Since there's no known waypoint for Microwaves, this step cannot be completed.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": [value from E5 Entrance],\n        \"y\": [value from E5 Entrance]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: Microwaves\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
