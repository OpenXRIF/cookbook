    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Take my to the HubRobo.\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. It seems like they want me to go to a location called \"HubRobo.\" But wait, is that actually a valid waypoint? I remember seeing a list of waypoints at the beginning. I should check if \"HubRobo\" is among them.\n\nLooking through the list: There's HubRobo in different areas\u2014like in the Middle Area and East Complex. So yes, it exists. Now, the user said \"Take my to the HubRobo.\" Hmm, that wording feels off. It doesn't specify where I should go from or what action to take once there.\n\nMaybe they meant to navigate directly to HubRobo without any prior location? If so, I can just tell them to go to HubRobo Entrance with coordinates. But if \"Take my\" refers to moving relative to a starting point mentioned earlier, like the Starting Locations at (0,0), then I need more information.\n\nSince there's no additional context given about where they're coming from or what action to take next, the safest assumption is that they just want me to navigate directly to HubRobo. Therefore, I should provide their coordinates so they can move there.\n</think>\n\nTo assist the user in navigating to HubRobo, here are the step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. **Navigate** to HubRobo Entrance at (250.0, 750.0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"HubRobo - Hub Complex Area\",\n                \"x\": 250,\n                \"y\": 750\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
