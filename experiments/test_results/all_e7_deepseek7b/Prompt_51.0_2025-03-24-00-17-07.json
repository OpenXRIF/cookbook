For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Experiment ID": 7.0,
    "Prompt ID": 51.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what's being asked. The user wants to go to the E5 Entrance first and then locate the Microwaves. So, there are two main actions here: navigating to a specific location and then finding something else once there.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I need to check if both \"E5 Entrance\" and \"Microwaves\" exist in our list. From the provided data, E5 Entrance is listed under the Available Functions with coordinates (1535, 1535), so that's definitely a valid waypoint. Now, checking for Microwaves\u2014I don't see it explicitly mentioned among the waypoints provided. The examples include things like \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" and others, but noMicrowave waypoint. So, Microwaves doesn't exist in our list.\n\nNext, I need to follow the rules outlined for handling commands. The user's prompt is a two-step instruction: first navigate to E5 Entrance, then find Microwaves. Since Microwaves isn't present, according to the edge cases specified, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, we should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and explain that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, for the first part of the command, moving to E5 Entrance is straightforward\u2014it's a valid waypoint. I'll include an navigate action pointing to it. But when trying to find Microwaves, since there's no such waypoint, I can't fulfill that part.\n\nHowever, the prompt says \"then find the Microwaves.\" Since we can't find them, but the initial step is possible, do I handle both actions or just acknowledge the first? The examples given show handling each action in sequence. So even if the second action isn't valid, perhaps we should still output the first part.\n\nBut according to the edge case specified, if a waypoint doesn't exist, return an error message. However, since the first step is successfully navigated, maybe it's okay to include that action but then fail on the next. Alternatively, because the entire command requires both steps and one fails, perhaps we need to handle it differently.\n\nLooking back at the example provided in the problem statement where a waypoint wasn't found, the response was an error message with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" But in another example, when a function beyond supported actions was requested, it returned an error. However, this prompt is within supported functions but involves two steps, one of which doesn't exist.\n\nI think the best approach here is to check if both waypoints are present before proceeding further. Since Microwaves don't exist, the entire command can't be completed as intended. Therefore, I should output a speak action informing the user that the second part isn't possible because the waypoint is unknown.\n\nSo, in summary:\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance: Valid, so include this action.\n2. Find Microwaves: Invalid, since Microwaves doesn't exist, so return an error message.\n\nBut wait, according to the problem's handling of complex commands, if multiple steps are involved and one fails, do we still output the successful part or just acknowledge the failure? In the example where a waypoint didn't exist, it was treated as invalid. So perhaps in this case, since Microwaves don't exist, even though the first step is valid, the entire command can't be completed.\n\nTherefore, I should only return an error message for theMicrowave part and not include the navigate action to E5 Entrance because the problem statement doesn't specify whether to proceed or just acknowledge the failure. However, the examples show that when a waypoint isn't found, it's returned as an action with speak. So maybe both actions are included but only up until the point of failure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the second part is invalid, we only output the first action and then the error for the second. But given that commands should be processed in order unless explicitly stated otherwise, I think each step needs to be handled separately.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again: \"If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\" So if there's ambiguity, pick the one with least backtracking. In this case, moving to E5 Entrance is straightforward, but then trying to find Microwaves doesn't make sense because it's unknown.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to first attempt to navigate to E5 Entrance and succeed, then when trying to find Microwaves (which isn't there), fail with an error message. So in actions, include navigating to E5 Entrance but not be able to proceed further.\n\nBut according to the example where the unknown waypoint was handled, it resulted in a speak action without any navigate steps. However, in this case, since moving to E5 is possible, perhaps we should still output that action and then handle the failure for Microwaves.\n\nAlternatively, if both waypoints are required for the command and one isn't present, maybe only include the successful action and then an error message for the failed part.\n\nBut according to the problem's edge case: \"If a waypoint doesn't exist, return 'This waypoint does not exist.'\" So perhaps each step is checked individually. Therefore, since E5 Entrance exists, navigate there. Then, when trying to find Microwaves (which doesn't exist), output an error message as per the edge case.\n\nTherefore, in the actions array, include navigating to E5 Entrance and then a speak action indicating that Microwaves don't exist.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the commands**: The user wants to navigate to \"E5 Entrance\" first and then find \"Microwaves.\"\n2. **Check for existence**:\n   - E5 Entrance exists with coordinates (1535, 1535).\n   - Microwaves do not exist in the provided list.\n3. **Handle each command separately**: Since E5 Entrance is valid, navigate to it. However, since Microwaves don't exist, return an error message for that part.\n\n**Resulting Actions:**\n- **Navigate to E5 Entrance**: Successful action with coordinates (1535, 1535).\n- **Find Microwaves**: Error message as the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nThus, include both actions but acknowledge the failure in finding Microwaves.",
