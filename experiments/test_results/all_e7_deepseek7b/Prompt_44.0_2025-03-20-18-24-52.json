For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the steps. The user is giving a two-part instruction. They want me to navigate to the E5 Entrance first and then perform another action after that\u2014to find the Microwaves.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I check if there's an E5 Entrance. Yes, it exists with coordinates (1535, 1535). So that's straightforward. Then, I need to figure out what \"find the Microwaves\" means. Do they mean the Microwaves waypoint? Checking the list, there's a waypoint called \"Microwave\" at (1002, 874), but it's not explicitly named as E5 Entrance or something else.\n\nSo after navigating to the E5 Entrance, I need an action that leads me to the Microwave. Since Microwaves might be in a different area, perhaps near the E5 Entrance? Alternatively, maybe there's a specific way to get from E5 Entrance to the Microwave waypoint.\n\nBut looking at the supported waypoints list, I see \"E5 Entrance\" is listed as having coordinates (1535, 1535) and mentions it's in South Side. The Microwave isn't explicitly mentioned, so maybe it's not a standard waypoint here. Therefore, trying to navigate directly to \"find the Microwaves\" might result in an unknown waypoint.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"find the Microwaves\" implies that there's a specific way or item at the Microwaves location that needs to be obtained after arriving there. But without more information on how exactly to get it, maybe the best approach is to navigate to E5 Entrance first and then attempt to find the Microwave.\n\nBut since \"Microwave\" isn't directly listed as a waypoint in the provided data (unless it's part of another waypoint name), I might have to assume that once at E5 Entrance, I can interact with the Microwave somehow. Alternatively, maybe there's an action called \"find\" that can be used after arriving at E5 Entrance.\n\nWait, looking back, the available functions are only \"navigate\", \"speak\", and \"wait\". So I can't perform any actions beyond those unless they're supported. Therefore, after navigating to E5 Entrance, if I need to find something there, perhaps it's not possible with the current capabilities because \"find\" isn't an action I can take.\n\nSo maybe the answer is just to navigate to the E5 Entrance and then attempt a \"wait\", but since the user wants to find the Microwaves after that, which might be unknown or not supported, the final action would have to fall back on speaking with an error message.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let me re-express the steps:\n\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n2. Find Microwaves (which isn't directly a waypoint in our data).\n\nSince \"find\" isn't a supported function, and \"Microwave\" isn't explicitly listed as a waypoint, I can't perform that action. Therefore, after navigating to E5 Entrance, the next step would be an unknown waypoint or an error.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, output actions with speak indicating it doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the actions would first navigate to E5 Entrance, then since \"find Microwaves\" is not a known waypoint, return an error message.\n</think>\n\nThe user's command involves navigating to a specific location and then attempting another action which isn't supported. Here's how we handle it:\n\n1. **Navigate to the E5 Entrance**:\n   - Confirm that \"E5 Entrance\" exists with coordinates (1535, 1535).\n\n2. **Attempt to find Microwaves**:\n   - Since there's no waypoint named \"Microwave\", this step results in an unknown location.\n\n**Final Actions**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 1535,\n        \"y\": 1535\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Microwaves' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
