    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to handle this prompt. The user wants me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand if both points are valid waypoints. For the E5 Entrance, looking through the list of available waypoints, there doesn't seem to be an entry for E5. So that's probably unknown.\n\nNext, the Microwaves point is also not listed in any of the provided waypoint information. It's another unknown location.\n\nSince both required waypoints aren't recognized, according to the guidelines, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, I need to output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and provide an error message. The example used phrases like \"invalid zone\" or similar, so following that pattern would be appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: E5 Entrance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
