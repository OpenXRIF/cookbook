For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\"\n",

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to handle the user prompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the user is asking. They mention wanting to go for a shower. Looking at the list of waypoints provided, I see several showers mentioned: Shower A and Shower B in the East Side areas.\n\nShower A has coordinates (827, 610) and Shower B has (825, 610). Both are very close to each other, just a couple units apart. Since both are valid and near each other, I need to decide which one to choose. \n\nThe user didn't specify a particular location, so either shower would be appropriate. However, since Shower A has slightly different coordinates but is essentially the same spot as B due to their proximity, it's safe to select one of them.\n\nIn the response examples provided, when multiple valid waypoints are present and close to each other, the system chooses the first matching one based on some criteria like order in the list or proximity. In this case, I'll choose Shower A at (827, 610) as the action.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A - East Side\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
