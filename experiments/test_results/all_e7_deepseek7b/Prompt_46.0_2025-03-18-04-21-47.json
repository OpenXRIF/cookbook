    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The prompt says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the waypoints mentioned here. There are two main parts: the E5 Entrance and finding the Microwaves.\n\nStarting with \"E5 Entrance,\" but looking through the available waypoints, I don't see an exact match for E5. The closest is \"E5 - Main Entrance\" at coordinates (200, 10). So, I can consider this as a valid waypoint since it's close and likely represents what the user means.\n\nNext, the second part is finding Microwaves. There are two possible waypoints related to microwaves: \"Microwave Oven - Fridge Unit\" and \"Microwave Oven - Walk-in.\" Since both have \"Microwave Oven\" in their names, I can choose either based on context. Without more information, picking one randomly might not be accurate. However, if the user is inside a building with microwaves, perhaps the first one makes sense.\n\nNow, considering navigation instructions, after going to E5 Entrance at (200, 10), the next step would be navigating to either of the microwave waypoints. Assuming the user wants to go directly from E5 to one of them, I'll pick \"Microwave Oven - Fridge Unit\" as a specific point.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions should first navigate to the E5 Entrance and then to the chosen Microwave waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 - Main Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 200,\n        \"y\": 10\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Microwave Oven - Fridge Unit\",\n        \"x\": 43.984,\n        \"y\": 75.396\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
