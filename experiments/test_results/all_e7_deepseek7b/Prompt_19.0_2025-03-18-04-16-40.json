    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the user is asking. They want me to navigate to the Ideas Clinic first and then go to the Assembly Room. I need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, I'll check if both waypoints exist. The Ideas Clinic has multiple entries like Ideas Clinic (A) at (100, 50), so that's definitely a known waypoint. The Assembly Room is also listed as Room 304 - Assembly Room with coordinates (200, 75). So both are valid.\n\nNow, according to the commands, I should first navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room. That means I need two actions: one for each waypoint.\n\nI'll structure the response by creating a list of actions. The first action will be navigating to the Ideas Clinic with its specific coordinates. The second action will be moving to the Assembly Room from there.\n\nWait, but are these waypoints close enough that I can go directly without any issues? Well, in the context of this problem, it's assumed that navigation works as intended based on the provided coordinates. So I don't need to worry about pathfinding or anything like that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the actions array will have two elements: the first is navigating to Ideas Clinic at (100, 50), and the second is navigating to Assembly Room at (200, 75). That should fulfill the user's request accurately.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Ideas Clinic (A)\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 50\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 304 - Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": 200,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
