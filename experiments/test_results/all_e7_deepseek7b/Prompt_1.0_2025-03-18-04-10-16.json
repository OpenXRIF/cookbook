    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this user prompt step by step. The user wrote, \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" My job is to figure out how to respond with the correct actions based on the guidelines provided.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if these are valid waypoints. From the list of starting locations and available functions, I see that there's a waypoint called \"North Entrance\" but no entry for a \"Main Entrance.\" So, when the user mentions \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" it's not listed because \"Main Entrance\" isn't among the known waypoints.\n\nNext, according to the advanced fuzzy matching rules, if the input doesn't match any known waypoint with sufficient similarity (which in this case is 80% or more), I should output a speak action saying that the requested waypoints don't exist. Since \"C&D - Main Entrance\" isn't present, it's an unknown waypoint.\n\nI also need to consider how to structure the response. The user's command mentions two steps: going to the North Entrance and then proceeding to another location which doesn't exist. However, since one of them is invalid, I can't execute both actions. Therefore, the appropriate action is a speak message indicating that 'C&D - Main Entrance' isn't supported.\n\nI don't need to process any navigation commands because the waypoints aren't valid, so there's no need for movement instructions or waiting. The response should be straightforward and convey the lack of support for the specified waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"C&D - Main Entrance is not a known waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
