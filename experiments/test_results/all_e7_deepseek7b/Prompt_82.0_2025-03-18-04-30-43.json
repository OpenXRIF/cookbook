    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Can you go to the Dairy Queen?\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking. They're saying they want to go somewhere called the Dairy Queen. So my initial thought is that I should check if there's a waypoint named Dairy Queen in the list provided.\n\nLooking back at the waypoints, I see several like RoboHub Entrance, Dairy Farm, etc., but I don't spot a Dairy Queen listed. That makes me think it's an unknown waypoint. According to the instructions, when a waypoint is unknown, I need to output a speak action saying that it doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, before jumping to conclusions, maybe the user misspelled something or there's another name for their intended destination. Let me scan through all the waypoints again just to be sure. No, Dairy Queen isn't listed anywhere else in the names. So yeah, it seems like they're referring to an unknown place.\n\nNow, according to the handling complex commands section, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, I should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input stating that the waypoint doesn't exist. There's no need for navigate or anything else because the user didn't ask how to get there; they just asked if it exists.\n\nI also recall that in examples provided earlier, when a prompt refers to an unknown zone, the response was similar\u2014just a speak action with an error message. So this fits into that pattern.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the user might have meant something else by Dairy Queen but didn't specify correctly or if there's another way to interpret it. However, without more context, I can't assume any other waypoints beyond what's listed. So sticking with \"unknown\" seems appropriate here.\n\nIn summary, since \"Dairy Queen\" isn't a known waypoint and no alternative interpretations are evident from the given information, the correct response is to inform the user that this destination doesn't exist through a speak action.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the User's Request:** The user asked for guidance on going to \"Dairy Queen.\"\n2. **Check Waypoints List:** Reviewing all known waypoints, none match \"Dairy Queen.\"\n3. **Determine Appropriate Response:** Since the destination isn't found and no alternative interpretations are evident, respond with a speak action indicating non-existence.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
