    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the command. It seems like there are two main actions here: moving to the Temporary Booth and then waiting for 30 minutes. The structure looks like a sequence where the first action is navigating to the booth, followed by waiting.\n\nLooking at the supported functions, we have \"navigate\", \"speak\", and \"wait\". So both actions should be possible. Now, I need to check if \"Temporary Booth\" is a known waypoint. From the list provided, I see that there's a \"Temporary Booth\" listed under the available waypoints with coordinates (827, 610). That means it exists.\n\nNext, for navigation, I'll construct an input object specifying the name as \"Temporary Booth\", x: 827, and y: 610. So the first action will be to navigate there.\n\nAfter reaching the booth, the next step is to wait for 30 minutes. The waiting function can handle this by setting the duration parameter to 30. This should come after the navigation action.\n\nI need to ensure that these actions are processed in order without any backtracking. Since both actions are straightforward and there's no ambiguity, it's safe to execute them sequentially. There's no need for multiple steps or alternative interpretations here.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'll create an array with two actions: first navigate to the Temporary Booth at (827, 610), then wait for 30 minutes.\n</think>\n\nThe user's command involves navigating to a specific waypoint and then waiting for a certain duration. Since \"Temporary Booth\" is a known waypoint, we can execute both actions without issues.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Temporary Booth\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 30\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
