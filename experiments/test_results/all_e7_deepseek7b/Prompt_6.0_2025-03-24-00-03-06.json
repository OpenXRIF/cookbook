For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" \n\nFirst, the goal is to make sure the user gets a refreshing session by going through two showers and waiting for a minute after the second one. I know the user wants to navigate to these shower areas in sequence.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, there's no direct \"Shower A\" or \"Shower B.\" The closest are Shower 1427 - Room 1427 (which is actually the Ideas Clinic) and Shower E5 Entrance. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me check again.\n\nNo, in the waypoints list, I see \"Shower A\" isn't listed, but there's a Shower B at (610, 610). Oh, wait, looking back: Yes, Shower B is at E5 Entrance? No, no, I think I got confused. Let me look again.\n\nWait, under the waypoints:\n\n- E5 Entrance has coordinates 1535,1535 and mentions it's part of South Side.\n- Shower A isn't listed; only Shower B is at (610,610) with a room name \"Clean\" and \"Wash.\"\n\nHmm, but in the list, I think I might have missed something. Wait, let me check:\n\nNo, the user's provided waypoints don't include \"Shower A,\" so maybe it's not available. But then again, maybe they meant to refer to Shower B twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two showers: one at (610,610) and another elsewhere? Wait, no, according to the list, only Shower B is present as a separate waypoint with name \"Shower B\" and coordinates 610,610. So maybe the user made a typo.\n\nSo, perhaps they meant to go to Shower A first, but it's not available. But since it's called Shower A in their command, I need to handle that case by returning an unknown waypoint error if it doesn't exist.\n\nThen, after that, they want to go to Shower B. Since Shower B is already a valid waypoint, that's fine.\n\nAfter the second shower, they want to wait for 1 minute at Shower B and then continue.\n\nSo first step: Check if \"Shower A\" exists. Looking through the waypoints list provided earlier:\n\n- The only showers are \"Shower B\" with name at (610,610), and another at E5 Entrance? Wait no, looking back again: No, in the waypoint list under the user's input, I don't see a specific \"Shower A.\" Only \"Shower B.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"Shower A\" is actually called something else. Let me check:\n\nNo, it seems there are two showers listed as different names.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided by the user: The list includes various points like C&D Coffee Area, E5 Entrance, but no specific \"Shower A.\" So if the user refers to a non-existent waypoint, I need to handle that by returning an error message for an unknown zone.\n\nSo, the first action is to navigate to \"Shower A,\" which doesn't exist. Then, attempt to go to Shower B. But since the first step fails because there's no \"Shower A,\" perhaps the user meant to say \"Shower B\" both times? Or maybe it's a mistake.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if an unknown waypoint is referenced, return an error saying that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, handling this:\n\n1. Attempt to navigate to Shower A (unknown), so output a speak action with the error message about the unknown zone.\n2. Since the first step fails, perhaps the user's intention was just to go once through a shower and then proceed, but since they mentioned \"Shower A\" which doesn't exist, it's better to handle that error.\n\nWait, but the prompt is: \"Take me to Shower A, then Shower B.\" So both showers are needed. Since Shower A isn't available, the entire command should fail with an unknown zone error before even getting to Shower B.\n\nTherefore, the action would be to output a single speak action indicating that \"Shower A\" doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: Shower A\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
