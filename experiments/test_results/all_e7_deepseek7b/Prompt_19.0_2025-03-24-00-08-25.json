For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then to the Assembly Room based on the user's prompt. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand which waypoints are involved here. From the list provided, there's a waypoint called \"Ideas Clinic\" at coordinates (2500, 175). But wait, the prompt mentions going to the Assembly Room next. Hmm, looking through the waypoints, I don't see an \"Assembly Room.\" Maybe it's another name or perhaps it's a different building. Alternatively, maybe the user meant a specific room within a building.\n\nLooking back at the list of waypoints, I notice several that start with \"Room\" and have numbers, like \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic.\" So if the user is moving to the Ideas Clinic after going somewhere else, perhaps they're referring to this room. But without an explicit \"Assembly Room\" waypoint, I'm a bit confused.\n\nI think the best approach here is to check if there's a known waypoint that matches \"Assembly Room.\" Scanning through the list, I don't see any such entry. The closest one might be \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic,\" but that's not an Assembly Room.\n\nNow, according to the rules, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, we should output a speak action saying it doesn't exist. So in this case, since there's no \"Assembly Room\" waypoint listed, I might have to respond with that message.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps \"Assembly Room\" is another name for a different waypoint? Let me check again. Nope, the list includes waypoints like E5 Entrance, which are specific and distinct from Assembly Room.\n\nAlternatively, could it be a typo or miscommunication? Maybe the user meant a different location. But without more information, I can't assume that. So sticking to what's provided, \"Assembly Room\" isn't listed among the known waypoints.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that navigating to an unknown waypoint after Ideas Clinic would require me to speak and inform the user about the missing waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Assembly Room' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
