    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this user prompt that says, \"Go North Entrance and then proceed to C&D - Main Entrance.\" Let me try to figure out what the correct response should be.\n\nFirst off, looking at the starting locations, it's (0.0, 0.0). The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So I need to break down the user's request step by step.\n\nThe first part of the prompt is \"Go North Entrance.\" From what I recall, there's a waypoint called \"North Entrance\" at coordinates (500, 200). So that should be straightforward\u2014navigate to that location.\n\nNext, the user says \"and then proceed to C&D - Main Entrance.\" Now, I remember seeing a waypoint named \"C&D - Coffee Area\" with coordinates (100, 100), but is there a \"Main Entrance\" in the C&D area? Wait, maybe it's supposed to be \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" but looking back at the provided waypoints, that exact name doesn't exist. The closest I see is \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So if the user refers to that as the main entrance, perhaps there's a mistake in the waypoint name.\n\nBut since \"C&D - Main Entrance\" isn't listed, I should check if it exists or if maybe it's just an alternative name for another waypoint. However, based on the provided data, it doesn't seem like such a waypoint exists. So that might be considered invalid.\n\nNow, looking at the functions, after navigating to North Entrance, the next step is to navigate again towards what I think the user intended\u2014probably \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" But since they mentioned \"Main Entrance,\" and if that's not present, perhaps it should fall back to an unknown waypoint. \n\nSo according to the instructions, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, we output a speak action saying the waypoint doesn't exist. So the second navigate command would fail because there's no such waypoint.\n\nPutting it all together, the first navigate goes to North Entrance, then trying to navigate again but failing because \"C&D - Main Entrance\" isn't available. Therefore, the actions should include both steps with appropriate error handling for the unknown waypoint.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's request, we'll break down the commands and execute them step by step.\n\n1. **Navigate to North Entrance**: This is a known waypoint at (500, 200).\n2. **Attempt to Proceed to C&D - Main Entrance**: Unfortunately, this waypoint does not exist in our list.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Action: Navigating to North Entrance**\n   - **Input:** Navigate to the waypoint named \"North Entrance\" at coordinates (500, 200).\n\n2. **Attempt to Proceed to C&D - Main Entrance**\n   - Since there is no known waypoint named \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" this command will result in an error.\n\n### Final Actions:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 500,\n                \"y\": 200\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'C&D - Main Entrance' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
