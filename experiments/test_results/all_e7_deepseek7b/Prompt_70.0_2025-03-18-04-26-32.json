    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the prompt \"I could really go for a shower.\" Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to identify any known waypoints related to showers. Looking at the list provided, there's a waypoint called Shower B located at (827, 610). The name is \"Shower B\" and it doesn't have any complex tokens that might be considered extraneous codes or non-essential identifiers.\n\nNext, I should check if there are other possible showers. However, based on the given data, only Shower B matches. So, since this is a direct match, there's no need for fuzzy matching because the name is exact and fits one of the known waypoints.\n\nNow, considering the user's command about needing a shower doesn't specify where exactly they want to go. But according to the available functions, we can either navigate to a specific location or do something else like wait or speak. Since the prompt is about wanting a shower, which implies needing to go somewhere for it, but without more details, the most logical action would be to navigate to the Shower B location.\n\nI should also consider if there's any way to infer where they want to take a shower from other given commands, like \"RoboHub\" or \"C and D areas\". However, in this case, none of those are related to showers. So, it's safe to assume they just need to go to Shower B.\n\nTherefore, the action is straightforward: navigate to Shower B at (827, 610).\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n                \"x\": 827,\n                \"y\": 610\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
