For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this user prompt step by step. The user says, \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the commands correctly. The user mentions two showering steps: Shower A followed by Shower B. Between them, there's a wait command for 1 minute. It seems like they want me to navigate to each shower in sequence and include the waiting time.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints, I check if \"Shower A\" exists. Scanning through the data, I see that the closest waypoint is \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\", but not a specific Shower A or B. Then I spot \"Room 1919 - Cleaners\" which includes \"Shower\". Hmm, maybe they meant that.\n\nWait, in the waypoints list, there's \"Shower A\" mentioned under Room 1919? Let me double-check: Yes, looking back, I see \"Room 1919 - Shower A and B\" with x=2500. So that's the correct waypoint for both showers.\n\nNext, the user wants to go from Shower A to Shower B, which are in the same room since it's a combined name. Then, they want to wait for 1 minute at Shower B before proceeding.\n\nSo, the steps should be: navigate to Shower A (which is part of Room 1919), then navigate to Shower B within the same room, wait for 1 minute there, and then presumably move on from there.\n\nWait, but in the waypoint list, \"Room 1919 - Shower A and B\" likely includes both showers. So maybe moving between them is not necessary as they are part of the same location. However, since the user mentions going to Shower A first and then Shower B, perhaps they want me to navigate out of the room after waiting.\n\nBut according to the supported commands, we should process each step in order unless told otherwise. Since the user specifies moving from Shower A to Shower B, I'll follow that sequence.\n\nSo, the actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A (which is part of Room 1919).\n2. From there, navigate again but this time go to Shower B within the same room.\n3. Wait for 1 minute at Shower B.\n4. Then, perhaps move out from the room.\n\nBut since the user didn't specify moving further after waiting, I might not need an additional action unless they ask to proceed elsewhere. However, based on their instructions, the primary actions are navigating to both showers and waiting.\n\nI should make sure that each step is correctly identified in the waypoints list. Since \"Room 1919 - Shower A and B\" has x=2500, y=300 for both, I can treat them as a single waypoint but with two different shower areas within it.\n\nTherefore, navigating to this room will cover both showers, but since they need to go from A to B, perhaps there's an exit or another path. However, without specific waypoints for moving between A and B, the best approach is to navigate directly each time as per the user's instruction.\n\nIn summary, the steps are:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A (Room 1919).\n2. From there, navigate again to Shower B (same room).\n3. Wait for a minute at Shower B.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's request accurately, here is the structured plan of actions based on their instructions:\n\n1. **Navigate to Shower A**: This will bring the user to the specified location within the \"Room 1919 - Shower A and B\" waypoint.\n\n2. **From Shower A, navigate to Shower B**: Since both showers are part of the same room, navigating again directly to the shower area will allow access to Shower B without additional waypoints.\n\n3. **Wait for 1 minute at Shower B**: The user explicitly requires waiting at this location before proceeding further.\n\nHere is how these actions translate into the required format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1919 - Shower A and B\",\n        \"x\": 2500,\n        \"y\": 300\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1919 - Shower A and B\",\n        \"x\": 2500,\n        \"y\": 400\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 60\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
