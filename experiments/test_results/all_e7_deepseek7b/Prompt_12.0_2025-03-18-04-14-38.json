    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into parts. The user is asking to go to the elevators, wait there for 15 seconds, and then proceed to the East Entrance.\n\nLooking at the available functions: navigate, speak, and wait. So the actions needed are navigating to the Elevators, waiting, and then navigating again to the East Entrance.\n\nI need to check if \"Elevators\" is a known waypoint. From the provided data, I don't see an entry for Elevators. There's no mention of it in any of the waypoints listed. So that means I can't navigate there directly because it doesn't exist.\n\nSince the first part requires navigating to a non-existent waypoint, according to the rules, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, I have to output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and explain that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo my response should inform the user that the Elevators don't exist. But wait, maybe there's another interpretation? The user might be implying a specific path or perhaps there's a waypoint called Elevators that I'm missing from the data provided. Let me double-check the list of waypoints.\n\nLooking through all the waypoints: Coffee Area, Ideas Clinic, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but no Elevators. So it's definitely unknown.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response is to use the speak action with a message stating that 'Elevators' does not exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'elevators' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
