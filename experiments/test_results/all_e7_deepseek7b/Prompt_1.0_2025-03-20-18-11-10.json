For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\"\n",

    "Prompt ID": 1.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this prompt: \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" I need to figure out how to translate that into actions based on the given waypoints.\n\nFirst off, let's break down the prompt. It says two things: go to the North Entrance first, then move on to the C&D - Main Entrance. So essentially, it's a sequence of two navigate actions. \n\nLooking at the starting location, it's (0,0). The first step is to navigate to the North Entrance. I need to check if \"North Entrance\" is one of the available waypoints. Looking through the list provided:\n\n- There's a waypoint called \"C&D - Coffee Area\" with coordinates (951, 616) but that's not the North Entrance.\n- Wait, in the starting section, it just says Starting Locations: X=0,Y=0, nothing about North Entrance. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the waypoints list:\n\n- \"E5 Entrance\" is a waypoint with coordinates (1535, 1535). So perhaps that's not the North Entrance either. Maybe the North Entrance doesn't have a specific name in this dataset?\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps \"North Entrance\" refers to a general location or maybe there's an implied waypoint. But from the given list, I don't see any waypoint named \"North Entrance.\" So according to the supported edge cases, if the waypoint doesn't exist, we need to return an action with speak and a message saying it doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, the user is telling me to go there anyway, so maybe that's part of the command. If I can't find \"North Entrance,\" perhaps I should respond accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"North Entrance\" refers to the starting location or another waypoint I'm not seeing. Let's check:\n\n- The starting point is (0,0). None of the waypoints have x=0,y=0 except that's where we start.\n- There's a waypoint called \"Shower A\" at (951,616), but that's in East side.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe \"North Entrance\" is supposed to be an implied waypoint or it's part of the main entrance somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is a known waypoint? Looking through the list:\n\n- There are multiple C&D areas like Coffee, Main, etc., but do they have entrances?\n\nWait, no. The C&D - Coffee Area has an entrance as well? Or perhaps the \"Main Entrance\" of C&D isn't listed here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check for exact matches or possible typos.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's go back to the process:\n\n1. Parse the command: Go to X and then Y.\n2. X: North Entrance\n3. Y: C&D - Main Entrance\n\nSince both are waypoints, but neither exists in the dataset as per the given list (except \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is listed), perhaps I need to check if these exist.\n\nBut since they don't seem to be present except for Coffee and others under C&D, maybe I should respond that both points don't exist. But according to the prompt, it says to proceed regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"C&D - Main Entrance\" refers to a waypoint in the dataset but with an incorrect name? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list again: There is \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"Room 1020 - C&D Main Entrance\" \u2014 wait! Yes, that's there. So the waypoint for C&D - Main Entrance is Room 1020.\n\nSo maybe when the user says \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" it refers to Room 1020.\n\nBut then, what about \"North Entrance\"? There isn't one listed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should assume that both are valid waypoints: North Entrance as a waypoint and C&D - Main Entrance as another.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n- First navigate to North Entrance (which is unknown; so action speak with message).\n- Then navigate to C&D - Main Entrance, which exists.\n\nBut since \"North Entrance\" isn't in the dataset, perhaps we have to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is Room 1020, and \"North Entrance\" refers to a waypoint not listed here. So if I can't find it, I have to return speak action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nBut then again, the user instruction says to go there regardless, so perhaps we should proceed as best as possible.\n\nWait, looking back at the starting location is (0,0). Maybe \"North Entrance\" refers to a waypoint with coordinates (some x,y) that's not listed here. Since it's not in the dataset, I can't navigate there, so I have to respond accordingly.\n\nBut then, what about moving on? If I can't go to North Entrance, maybe the next step is impossible too.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is reachable from (0,0) directly without needing intermediate steps. But in this case, since the first waypoint doesn't exist, it's impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo considering all that, my response should probably be:\n\n- First navigate to North Entrance, which doesn't exist, so speak and say it doesn't exist.\n- Then try to go to C&D - Main Entrance, which is Room 1020. Since we can't get to North Entrance, moving on isn't possible either.\n\nBut the user says \"then proceed,\" implying that after going to North Entrance, move to C&D - Main Entrance. But if you can't reach North Entrance, proceeding isn't possible.\n\nSo perhaps I should first respond about not being able to go to North Entrance and then attempt to navigate to Room 1020 from (0,0) directly?\n\nBut without knowing the coordinates of North Entrance or Room 1020 relative to (0,0), it's hard to say. Maybe the waypoints are arranged in a grid where each has incremental numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is at a known coordinate that I can navigate to from (0,0). Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list of waypoints and their coordinates:\n\n- Room 1020: C&D - Main Entrance\n- Room 1357: North Entrance? No, wait. There's \"Room 964\" at E1, which is East 1.\n- Wait, no, let me see all the entries with coordinates.\n\nWait, maybe I need to list all waypoints and their coordinates:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area (x=951,y=616)\n- C&D - Main Entrance? No listed; perhaps it's Room 1020.\n- C&D - Roaring Fork (x=?, y=?), but no, not here.\nWait, the list is as per provided:\n\nFrom \"C&,\" let me list all:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area: x=951,y=616\n- C&D - Main Entrance? No direct; Room 1020 is its location.\n- C&D - Roaring Fork (maybe another room, but not here)\nWait, no. Looking through the provided list again:\n\nLooking at all waypoints and their coordinates.\n\nIt seems that only certain rooms are listed under C&D, such as Coffee, Main Entrance (as a waypoint), Roaring Fork, etc., but maybe \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is Room 1020.\n\nBut for North Entrance, there's no entry except E1 at x=964,y=?, but that's East 1.\n\nWait, the starting point is (0,0). Then, let me list all waypoints and their coordinates:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area: 951,616\n- C&D - Main Entrance: 1020,?\n- C&D - Roaring Fork: perhaps another room.\nBut actually, looking through the list:\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify. The original list includes waypoints like:\n\nC&D - Coffee Area (x=951,y=616)\n\nThen in E1, x=964,y=?\n\nE1 is East 1: x=?, y=?\nLooking back at the provided data, there's an entry for \"Shower A\" which is x=?,y=?.\n\nWait, actually, it seems that the waypoints are spread across different buildings like C&D, E1, etc., but their exact coordinates aren't clearly given. Only for some of them:\n\nFor example:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area: (951,616)\n- Room 204: Not sure\nWait no.\n\nWait, the list is actually structured as different areas with multiple rooms and possibly entrances.\n\nGiven that, perhaps \"C&D - Main Entrance\" refers to Room 1020, which exists under C&D area. So if I can get to Room 1020 from (0,0), then proceed.\n\nBut without knowing the exact coordinates of North Entrance or Room 1020 relative to (0,0), it's hard to navigate directly. Alternatively, perhaps moving from (0,0) to C&D - Main Entrance is feasible as a direct move if there's no in-between steps specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"C&D - Main Entrance\" can be navigated directly from the starting location without needing to go through North Entrance first.\n\nBut per the prompt, it says \"Go to X and then Y,\" implying that both are necessary. So perhaps even if one isn't reachable, you have to mention it and proceed as much as possible.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\n1. First, try to navigate to North Entrance (which doesn't exist), so respond accordingly.\n2. Then attempt to go to C&D - Main Entrance (Room 1020) from the starting point or where we ended up after failing the first step.\n\nBut since I can't be sure of the exact coordinates relative to (0,0), perhaps I should just give instructions on how to navigate based on known waypoints. For example:\n\n- To get to C&D - Main Entrance (Room 1020), from (0,0) you might go to E1 first and then move north or something.\n\nBut without exact map info, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to recognize that \"North Entrance\" doesn't exist as a direct waypoint but needs to be navigated via another route. If so, after attempting North Entrance which isn't possible, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance if reachable from (0,0) or where we are.\n\nBut this is getting complicated without the exact map layout.\n\nGiven all that, my final response should acknowledge the inability to reach North Entrance and then attempt to go directly to C&D - Main Entrance (Room 1020), providing instructions as per known waypoints.\n</think>\n\nTo navigate through your desired locations based on the provided data:\n\n1. **North Entrance**: There is no direct waypoint for \"North Entrance\" listed in our data.
