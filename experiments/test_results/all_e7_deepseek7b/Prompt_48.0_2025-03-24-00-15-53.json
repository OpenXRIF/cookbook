For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, according to the problem statement, when processing a command, we should process each part of the command in order unless told otherwise. So, the first part is \"Travel to the E5 Entrance\" and the second part is \"find the Microwaves.\"\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints, I need to check if \"E5 Entrance\" exists. From the data provided, under Known Waypoints, there's an entry for \"E5 Entrance\": it has X=1535, Y=1535 and its name is \"E5 Entrance.\" So that should be navigable.\n\nNext, after reaching E5 Entrance, the user wants to find the Microwaves. Now, looking at the known waypoints, I don't see a waypoint named \"Microwave\" or anything related. The closest might be \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic,\" but that's not exactly microwaves.\n\nSince there's no specific waypoint for Microwaves, according to the supported edge cases, if an unknown waypoint is mentioned, we should return a speak action with a message saying it doesn't exist.\n\nSo putting it together: first navigate to E5 Entrance, then attempt to find Microwaves, which isn't available. But since finding Microwaves requires a waypoint that's not there, the second part would result in an error.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, if any unknown waypoint is referenced, we should output the speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So maybe after failing to find Microwaves, I need to address that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the command expects us to navigate once and then handle the second part. But since the second part isn't possible, do I include an error message in the actions?\n\nLooking at the examples, when there's a reference to an unknown waypoint, like \"unknown zone,\" it results in a single speak action with that message.\n\nIn this case, after navigating to E5 Entrance, attempting to find Microwaves would be another step. But since Microwaves aren't available, maybe the second action is invalid and should trigger an error.\n\nBut according to the handling of complex commands, if multiple steps are involved, we process them left-to-right unless told otherwise. So first, navigate to E5 Entrance, then try to find Microwaves.\n\nSince finding Microwaves isn't possible, perhaps that's where the failure occurs. But how is this represented in the actions array?\n\nLooking at the example where an unknown waypoint was requested, the output was a single speak action. Here, maybe after failing on the second part, it should still be included as a separate action.\n\nWait, let me check the handling of complex commands again. It says to process commands left-to-right unless told otherwise, and if multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. So in this case, since \"find the Microwaves\" is after navigating to E5 Entrance, we proceed as per command.\n\nSo first action: navigate to E5 Entrance.\n\nSecond action: attempt to find Microwaves. Since it's unknown, return a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nTherefore, the actions array should include two speak actions? Or just one?\n\nWait, no. Because in the example where an unknown zone was mentioned, only one speak action was returned, regardless of the command structure.\n\nBut in this case, the user's prompt is: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" So after failing to find Microwaves, should it still be part of the actions? Or does the failure mean that the entire command can't be completed?\n\nI think according to the problem statement, we need to process each step as per the user's instruction unless an error occurs. Since finding Microwaves is unknown, perhaps after navigating to E5 Entrance (which is successful), and then failing to find Microwaves would trigger a speak action.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if multiple speak actions should be included or just one for the unknown waypoint.\n\nWait, looking at the example where \"unknown zone\" was referenced in the prompt: \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\" The answer was a single speak action with an error message. It seems that even though there were two waypoints mentioned, only the unknown one resulted in an error because the other steps are skipped due to the first failure.\n\nBut according to our problem statement, when processing commands, we process each part left-to-right unless told otherwise. So if \"find the Microwaves\" is after navigating to E5 Entrance, both should be attempted.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance: successful action.\n\n2. Attempt to find Microwaves: fails because it's unknown, so output a speak action with error message for that step.\n\nThus, actions array would have two elements: the first is navigateToE5Entrance (which is navigable), and the second is a speak action saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nBut I'm unsure if both should be included or just one. Since in the problem statement's examples, when an unknown waypoint was part of the prompt, only that error message was output.\n\nHmm, perhaps after the first step (navigating to E5), since it's successful, but then trying to find Microwaves which is unknown, so the second action would be a speak. Therefore, actions array should include both steps: navigating and then an error.\n\nBut in the example with \"unknown zone,\" only one speak action was given because the command structure wasn't completed. However, that might have been because it's unclear whether to process further or not.\n\nI think to stick strictly to the problem statement, since we need to process each part of the command as per user instruction unless told otherwise, I'll include both actions: navigating to E5 Entrance and then trying to find Microwaves which fails.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the commands**: The user's prompt consists of two parts:\n   - \"Travel to the E5 Entrance\"\n   - \"find the Microwaves\"\n\n2. **Check if E5 Entrance exists**:\n   - From the known waypoints, E5 Entrance with X=1535 and Y=1535 is present.\n\n3. **Navigate to E5 Entrance**: Successful action as it's a navigable waypoint.\n\n4. **Attempt to find Microwaves**:\n   - No waypoint named \"Microwave\" exists in the known waypoints.\n   - Therefore, an error message is generated indicating that this waypoint does not exist.\n\n5. **Structure the response**:\n   - Include both steps since they are part of the user's command, even if one fails.\n\n**Actions Array**:\n\n- First action: Navigating to E5 Entrance.\n- Second action: Attempting to find Microwaves (results in an error).\n\nTherefore, the actions array will contain two elements as described.",
