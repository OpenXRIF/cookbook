    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. The user's prompt is: \"Let's chek out the Novelties store, and then head out the South Entrence.\" \n\nFirst, I need to process this command step by step. It looks like they have two main actions here. They want to check out a store and then go somewhere else.\n\nLooking at the first part, \"Novelties store,\" I remember from the waypoints that there's no exact name for it in the provided list. The closest is \"Novelties Store\" with X:425.0 Y:173.0, but the user wrote \"Novelties store.\" Hmm, maybe they misspelled or just used a different capitalization.\n\nThen, the second part is about exiting via the South Entrance. In the waypoints, there's a \"South Entrence\" listed as X:625.0 Y:-418.0. So that seems to match.\n\nSo, first action would be to navigate to the Novelties store if it exists or maybe not find it and return an error. But in the examples, unknown waypoints result in a speak action saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\" However, since there's another way to get out via South Entrence which is known.\n\nWait, but the prompt mentions two steps: check out the store and then exit through South Entrence. So maybe they want to go from wherever they are (starting at 0,0) first to the store and then to South Entrence.\n\nBut in the starting location, it's (0,0), so they need to navigate there first. But since \"Novelties store\" isn't a known waypoint, perhaps we have to assume that they might not exist or be unrecognized. So according to the edge cases, if an unknown waypoint is encountered, we return a speak action.\n\nSo maybe the initial step is to navigate to (425,173) for the store, but since it's unknown, instead of moving there, we have to handle that. Alternatively, perhaps they just want to go directly to South Entrence from 0,0? But that might not make sense.\n\nWait, in the examples, when an unknown waypoint is requested, the action is to speak and say it doesn't exist. So if \"Novelties store\" isn't a known waypoint, then navigating there would trigger that speak action. Then, perhaps after exiting the store (which we can't do because it's unknown), but maybe they meant to go from their current location directly to South Entrence.\n\nBut according to the steps, processing commands left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So first step is \"chek out the Novelties store.\" Since that's unknown, output speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nThen, next part: head out the South Entrence. That is a known waypoint at (625,-418). So after handling the first unknown waypoint, we can navigate to the South Entrence.\n\nSo overall actions would be:\n\n1. Speak about the unknown store.\n2. Navigate to South Entrence.\n\nBut wait, in the prompt, they say \"Let's check out... and then head out...\" so it implies two separate steps: check out (unknown) and then exit via South Entrence.\n\nTherefore, first action is speak because the Novelties store isn't found. Then, after that, navigate to South Entrence.\n\nSo I think that's how it should be structured.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"South Entrence\",\n        \"x\": 625,\n        \"y\": -418\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
