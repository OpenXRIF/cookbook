    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user says, \"I need freshen up. Take me Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we go can.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying the key actions here: taking showers and waiting before proceeding. So, the main tasks are to navigate to Shower A, shower there for a while, move on to Shower B after a delay, wait there for one minute, and then continue with whatever comes next.\n\nLooking at the available functions\u2014navigate, speak, and wait\u2014it seems like the user wants actions involving movement and waiting. They don't mention anything about speaking unless they need help during this process, but I don't see any specific commands to interact with others.\n\nNext, I check if there are known waypoints for the showers mentioned. From the list provided, there's \"Shower B\" at coordinates (827, 610). But there's no entry for \"Shower A.\" So, when trying to match \"Shower A,\" it doesn't correspond to any existing waypoint. That means I have to handle this as an unknown waypoint.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown, the response should involve using the speak action with a message saying that the waypoint does not exist. However, since the user also mentions moving from Shower A to Shower B and waiting, there's some implied sequence here. But without knowing where Shower A is, I can't perform those actions.\n\nSo, in this case, because \"Shower A\" isn't recognized, the appropriate response would be a speak action informing the user that \"Shower A doesn't exist.\" The rest of their instructions about showering at B and waiting can't be processed without knowing where A is located. \n\nI don't see any other functions requested besides navigate, speak, or wait, so no need to involve more complex actions unless specified otherwise. Since the primary issue here is the unknown waypoint, focusing on that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This shower does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
