For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the starting point is at (0, 0). The user wants a sequence of actions. They're asking to go to the Elevators first, wait for 15 seconds, and then proceed to the East Entrance.\n\nLooking at the available functions, we have \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" and \"wait.\" So I need to translate their instructions into these commands.\n\nThe first part is \"Take me to the Elevators.\" That seems straightforward. The target waypoint here is clearly mentioned as \"Elevators,\" which corresponds to the waypoint name. Checking the list provided, \"Elevators\" is one of them with coordinates (125, 73). So the first action should be a navigate command directing the user there.\n\nNext, the instruction says to \"Wait there for 15 seconds.\" Here, I need to make sure that after arriving at the Elevators, the user waits. Since the way to wait is through the \"wait\" function with a specified time in seconds, this translates into an action where they spend 15 seconds waiting at their current location.\n\nAfter waiting, the user wants to find the East Entrance. Wait, looking back at the waypoints provided, I don't see an \"East Entrance\" listed. The available elevators are mentioned but nothing about entrances on the east side except for Shower A and B, which are in the East Side section. So maybe the East Entrance refers to one of those? But according to the starting locations, it's (0,0), so perhaps the user is implying a different point.\n\nWait, no. The waypoints list includes \"East Entrance\" as E5 or others, but from the given data, there's an E5 waypoint with coordinates (1535, 1535). Alternatively, maybe they meant to go back to the starting location after waiting, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The user said \"then let's find the East Entrance.\" So after waiting at the Elevators for 15 seconds, they need to navigate to the East Entrance. But looking through the waypoints list provided by the user, there isn't an exact match for \"East Entrance.\" However, in the data, I see a waypoint called \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B,\" both on the East Side. Also, there's an E5 waypoint which is at (1535, 1535). \n\nBut wait, the user didn't specify any waypoint named \"East Entrance.\" So perhaps this is an issue. Alternatively, maybe they're referring to another entrance in their building that isn't listed here.\n\nSince the list doesn't include \"East Entrance,\" we might have to handle that. But according to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, return an action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nSo putting this together: The first navigate command goes to the Elevators at (125,73). Then wait for 15 seconds there. After that, attempt to navigate to the East Entrance. But since it's not listed, we have to output an error message.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread. Let me check again: The user said \"then let's find the East Entrance.\" So maybe after waiting, they go back somewhere else? Or is there another waypoint that could be considered as the East Entrance?\n\nLooking at the waypoints list provided by the user:\n\n- Elevators: x=125, y=73\n- Shower A: x=951, y=616\n- Shower B: x=951, y=616 (same as A)\n- East Entrance E5: x=1535, y=1535\n\nWait, but the user didn't list any waypoint called \"East Entrance.\" So perhaps they meant to go back to the starting location or another point. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for \"Shower B\" or another waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after waiting at Elevators for 15 seconds, they need to proceed to the East Entrance, but since that's not available, we have to output an error.\n\nSo in this case, the actions would be:\n\n1. Navigating to the Elevators (action: navigate, input: name=\"Elevators\", x=125, y=73).\n\n2. Waiting for 15 seconds at the current location (action: wait, input: time=15).\n\n3. Attempting to navigate to the East Entrance, but since it's not a known waypoint, this would result in an error message action.\n\nSo putting that together, the final answer should include these steps with the actions as per the functions.\n</think>\n\nThe user's prompt involves navigating to the \"Elevators,\" waiting for 15 seconds there, and then attempting to find the East Entrance. Based on the provided waypoints:\n\n1. **Navigate to the Elevators**: This is a known waypoint at coordinates (125,73).\n   \n   - Action: `navigate`, with input specifying the target as \"Elevators\" and coordinates (125, 73).\n\n2. **Wait for 15 seconds**: After arriving at the Elevators, wait there for 15 seconds.\n\n   - Action: `wait`, with input indicating a waiting time of 15 seconds.\n\n3. **Attempt to find the East Entrance**: Upon checking the available waypoints, \"East Entrance\" is not listed. Therefore, an error message will be generated to inform that this waypoint does not exist.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of actions to fulfill the user's request is as follows:\n\n1. `navigate` to the Elevators at (125, 73).\n   \n   - Action: `navigate`, input: \"Elevators\", x=125, y=73.\n\n2. Wait for 15 seconds at the current location.\n\n   - Action: `wait`, input: time=15.\n\n3. Attempting to navigate to an undefined waypoint (East Entrance), resulting in an error message action indicating that \"East Entrance\" is not available.\n\nThis approach ensures that all user instructions are translated into valid commands, and any unknown waypoints result in appropriate handling as per the edge cases documentation.",
