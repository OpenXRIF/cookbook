    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this user prompt that says: \"Robot, navigate to [[C&D - Hot Food Area]], announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly, and wait until further instructions.\" Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the robot needs to do a few things. It has to navigate to a specific waypoint called C&D - Hot Food Area. Then it needs to perform an action where it announces that name clearly. Finally, it should wait for further instructions.\n\nLooking at the functions available\u2014navigate, speak, and wait\u2014it seems like each of these steps can be handled by separate actions. The navigation part would involve moving to the waypoint, then speaking (announcing) that waypoint's name, followed by waiting until more commands are given.\n\nI need to check if the waypoint C&D - Hot Food Area exists. From the data provided earlier, I don't see any waypoint named exactly like that. Let me scan through the list... Hmm, there are places like C&D Coffee Area and others with \"C & D\" but not specifically mentioning aHot Food Area. So it's likely an unknown waypoint.\n\nBased on the supported edge cases, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an action that says it's unknown. That would be using the speak function to inform the user that this waypoint isn't available.\n\nSo putting it all together, since navigation is needed but the waypoint is unknown, maybe the robot can't complete the task as instructed and has to wait for further instructions or provide an error message.\n\nWait, no\u2014the prompt also includes announcing the waypoint. But if the waypoint doesn't exist, perhaps I should just skip that part and focus on the known actions.\n\nAlternatively, since navigation isn't possible without the waypoint, maybe the robot can't proceed beyond that step. So it would need to speak that the waypoint is unknown or something similar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to output an action where it says the waypoint doesn't exist. So, in JSON format, that would be a single speak action with the message indicating the waypoint isn't available.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
