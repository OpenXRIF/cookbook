For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 52.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what each part of the prompt is asking. It seems like there are two main tasks here: moving to the E5 Entrance and then locating the Microwaves after that.\n\nI remember from the examples given that when dealing with commands, they're processed in a left-to-right sequence unless told otherwise. So I should handle the first action before moving on to the next one.\n\nLet me start by identifying all the waypoints mentioned here. The user is talking about \"E5 Entrance\" and \"Microwaves.\" Looking back at the list provided earlier, I can see that E5 Entrance is listed as having certain tokens like \"E5,\" \"Engineering 5,\" etc. But there's no specific waypoint called \"Microwave\" or similar. That might be an issue.\n\nWait, in the supported edge cases, it says if a waypoint is unknown, return an action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So since Microwaves isn't listed, I can expect that part to trigger the unknown waypoint response.\n\nNow, looking at the waypoints again, E5 Entrance is a known location. It's located at specific coordinates: X-Coordinate 1535, Y-Coordinate 1535. That should be straightforward to navigate to.\n\nSo for the first action, I need to navigate to E5 Entrance with its coordinates. The input format expects an object with \"action\" as \"navigate,\" and a \"name\" field pointing to the waypoint name along with x and y values. So that part seems doable.\n\nThe second action is trickier because Microwaves aren't listed. I need to check if there's any way to interpret \"Microwaves.\" Maybe it's referring to an unknown waypoint? If that's the case, according to the edge cases, I should return a speak action saying that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nPutting this together, the first action is clear: navigate to E5 Entrance at 1535, 1535. The second action would be an attempt to find Microwaves, which isn't a known waypoint. So I need to handle both actions appropriately in sequence.\n\nI should make sure that each action is represented correctly in the output array. The first action will be navigate with E5 Entrance's coordinates. The second action, since it's an unknown waypoint, will trigger the speak action with the appropriate message.\n\nWait a minute, but when I look back at the supported edge cases, if both waypoints are unknown, does that mean each should have its own speak action? Or is there another way to interpret \"find the Microwaves\"? Maybe there's a different waypoint name for Microwaves that I'm not seeing. Let me double-check the list.\n\nLooking through all the waypoints again: C&D areas, RoboHub, Ideas Clinic, Room 1427, etc., but nothing about Microwaves. So it's safe to assume that \"Microwaves\" isn't a known waypoint.\n\nTherefore, each action should be handled as per the edge cases. The first is a navigate to E5 Entrance, and the second is an attempt to find an unknown waypoint, which would result in a speak action.\n\nI think I've got this figured out. Now, structuring the response according to the examples given.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the prompt \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves,\" we'll break it down into two sequential actions:\n\n1. **Navigate to E5 Entrance:** This is a known waypoint with specific coordinates (X: 1535, Y: 1535). The action will be to move there.\n\n2. **Find unknown Microwaves:** Since \"Microwaves\" isn't listed, we'll return an error message for this part.\n\nHere's the structured response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 1535,\n        \"y\": 1535\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: Microwaves\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
