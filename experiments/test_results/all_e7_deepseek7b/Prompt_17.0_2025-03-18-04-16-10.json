    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt using the given waypoints and functions. The user says, \"I'm feeling peckish. Can we swing by the C&D - Snack Area and then grab a drink at the C&D - Cold Drink Aeria?\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the user's request. They mention two places: the C&D Snack Area for snacks and the C&D Cold Drink Aeria for drinks. Both are under the C&D area, which probably means they're close to each other or part of a larger area.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I see there's \"C&D - Coffee Area\" but nothing exactly called C&D Snack Area or C&D Cold Drink Aeria. The closest is the Coffee Area, so maybe that can be used as a proxy for both snack and drink areas since they're in the same section.\n\nNext, the user wants to go to these spots and then grab drinks at another specific place. Since there's no exact match for the second part, we'll have to use the best available option, which is again \"C&D - Coffee Area.\"\n\nNow, considering the functions: navigate, speak, and wait. The user isn't directly asking to do anything besides describe their actions, so they might not need to wait unless there's an implied delay.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should include navigating to the C&D Coffee Area twice\u2014once for snacks and once for drinks. But since the Coffee Area is a single waypoint, we'll use it for both purposes as per the available data.\n\nSo, the actions would involve two navigate steps: first going to the Snack Area (using Coffee Area) and then to the Drink Area (again using Coffee Area). The user might be at the same location after grabbing snacks, so navigating once should suffice. But since they need to do both actions, we'll have two navigate actions.\n\nI think that's it. Using the best available waypoint for both snack and drink areas.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": [value],\n        \"y\": [value]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": [another value if needed],\n        \"y\": [another value if needed]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
