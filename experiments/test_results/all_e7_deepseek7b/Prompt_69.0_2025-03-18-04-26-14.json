    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to handle the user prompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking. They're talking about going for a shower. From the list of available functions, we have navigate, speak, and wait. So, the main action here seems to be taking a shower.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, there's one called \"Shower B\" with coordinates (827, 610). The name \"Shower B\" is pretty descriptive, so it should match the user's intent about going for a shower.\n\nNow, according to the rules, when matching waypoints, I need to normalize the input and remove any extraneous tokens. In this case, \"shower\" would be the main keyword. But since we have \"Shower B\" as a known waypoint, it should still match because after normalization, both would be lowercase.\n\nNext, tokenization: splitting \"I could really go for a shower.\" into individual words might give [\"I\", \"could\", \"really\", \"go\", \"for\", \"a\", \"shower\"]. But the waypoints' names are just single words like \"Shower B\". So the key token here is \"shower\".\n\nSince the waypoint name includes \"Shower B\" which, after normalization, would be \"shower b\", but our user input has only \"shower\", does that matter? Hmm, maybe not. Because during matching, we check if every token from the waypoint's name exists in the user's input. Alternatively, a high percentage of tokens need to match.\n\nWait, actually, the similarity calculation says to check if every token from the waypoint appears in the input or ensure 80% are present. Since \"Shower B\" is just one token \"shower b\", and our input has \"shower\" as part of it, maybe it's considered a match because \"shower\" is a substring.\n\nBut according to the rules, we split both cleaned user input and known waypoints into individual words. So the user input after normalization would be [\"i could really go for a shower\"], which when split further might not align with the waypoint's single token.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \"shower\" is part of the user's input and the waypoint has \"shower b\", perhaps the similarity isn't perfect but high enough. Alternatively, since \"shower\" is a key word in both, it should match.\n\nSo, considering all this, the best action would be to navigate to Shower B at (827, 610). \n\nI don't think any other waypoints are relevant here because none relate to showers. Also, there's no need to speak or wait; navigation is sufficient.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
