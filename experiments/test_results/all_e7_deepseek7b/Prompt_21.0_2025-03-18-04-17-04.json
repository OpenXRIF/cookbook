    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Let's check out Novelties store, and then head out South Entrance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the user is asking for. They want me to go to the Novelties store first and then proceed to the South Entrance. So, it seems like a two-step navigation task.\n\nLooking at the starting point, which is (0.0, 0.0), but there's no waypoint named Novelties store listed here. The available waypoints are things like Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but not Novelties store. So I'll have to check if that's a known waypoint.\n\nFrom the list provided, I don't see \"Novelties store\" or any similar name. The closest is maybe the Shower B or something else, but nothing matches. So I think this is an unknown waypoint.\n\nSince the first part of the command refers to an unknown zone (Novelties store), that's a problem because it's not listed as a valid waypoint. According to the handling complex commands section, if any step involves an unknown waypoint, we should return an action with \"speak\" and explain why it's invalid.\n\nSo, in this case, I can't proceed because the first stop is unknown. Therefore, the response should be to speak and inform the user that the Novelties store isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Novelties store' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
