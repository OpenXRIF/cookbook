    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this user prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" \n\nFirst off, I need to figure out if there's an existing waypoint named E7 Silent Study. Looking through the list provided, yes, there is a waypoint with that exact name.\n\nThe user hasn't provided any additional instructions beyond where they want to go. So, based on the available functions which include navigate, speak, and wait, since the prompt just asks for a destination without needing multiple steps, I can directly instruct them to navigate to E7 Silent Study.\n\nI don't see any need for speaking or waiting here; it's straightforward. Therefore, the action is simply to navigate to that waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E7 - Silent Study Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
