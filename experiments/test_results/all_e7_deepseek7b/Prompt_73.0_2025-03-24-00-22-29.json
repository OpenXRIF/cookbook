For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"I could really go for a shower.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt \"I could really go for a shower.\" based on the provided data and guidelines. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, I see several showers: Shower A is at (827, 610), Shower B at (827, 610) as well, Wait no, actually in the list, both Shower A and Shower B are mentioned but their coordinates might be different. Wait, checking again: Shower A is at (827,610) with tokens Clean and Wash, and Shower B is also at (827,610). Hmm, wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait the user provided waypoints have different coordinates? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list of waypoints:\n\n- Shower A: 827,610\n- Shower B: 827,610\n\nNo, both are at (827,610) and also (827,610). Wait no, actually in the data provided earlier, there were two showers:\n\nShower A: X=827,Y=610\nShower B: X=827,Y=610\n\nWait, but looking back at the list, both are at (827,610) and (827,610). Wait no, perhaps a typo. Wait in the initial data:\n\nLooking back through the waypoints:\n\nShower A: 827,610\nShower B: 827,610\n\nWait, actually both are at (827,610), but that seems odd. Maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I misread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinates for Shower B are different. Let me check again:\n\nIn the list of waypoints provided:\n\nShower A: X=827,Y=610\nShower B: X=827,Y=610\n\nWait no, actually in the data earlier:\n\nLooking through each waypoint:\n\n- Starting Locations at (874,613)\n\nThen, the list of waypoints includes:\n\n- Room 1003 - Student Lounge at 950,613\n- Room 1002 - Office at 940,613\n- Room 1001 - Common Area at 874,613\n- E5 Entrance at 1535,1535 (not relevant here)\n- E4 Entrance at 1535,1535 (but in the data, it's labeled as Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop)\n\nWait no, actually looking through:\n\nWait I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine all waypoints.\n\nList of waypoints:\n\n1. Starting Location: X=874,Y=613\n\nWaypoints available:\n\n- Room 1003 - Student Lounge at (950,613)\n- Room 1002 - Office at (940,613)\n- Room 1001 - Common Area at (874,613)\n- E5 Entrance at (1535,1535) with codes E5, Engineering 5, Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop\n- E4 Entrance at same coordinates as E5? Or different? Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait the data says:\n\nE5 Entrance: X=1535,Y=1535, labeled as E5, Engineering 5, Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop\n\nBut then there's another waypoint for E4 Entrance at same coordinates but it's separate?\n\nNo, I think the list is:\n\n- E5 Entrance at (1535,1535) with codes\n- E4 Entrance at (1535,1535) with Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop\n\nWait no, actually in the data provided earlier, it's written as:\n\nE5 Entrance: X=1535,Y=1535; words are E5, Engineering 5, Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop.\n\nSimilarly, another waypoint is labeled E4 Entrance at same coordinates with codes Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop.\n\nWait no, perhaps a misinterpretation. Let me look again:\n\nThe data says:\n\nE5 Entrance:\n- X=1535,Y=1535\n- Words: E5, Engineering 5, Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop\n\nThen another waypoint called E4 Entrance at same coordinates with words: Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop.\n\nWait that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and both are different, but for our purposes, the important point is that there are multiple showers at (827,610) as per the initial data.\n\nBut wait, looking back:\n\nThe list of waypoints provided includes:\n\n- Room 1003 - Student Lounge at 950,613\n- Room 1002 - Office at 940,613\n- Room 1001 - Common Area at 874,613\n- E5 Entrance at 1535,1535 with codes E5, Engineering 5, Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop\n- E4 Entrance at same as above but perhaps different words.\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nActually, the data says:\n\nE5 Entrance: X=1535,Y=1535; entries are E5, Engineering 5, Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop\n\nThen another waypoint called E4 Entrance with same coordinates but labeled as Design Teams, Machine Shop, Student Shop.\n\nWait that can't be right. Perhaps it's a separate entity? Or maybe they're the same location but different entrance points?\n\nBut for our purpose, we need to identify showers.\n\nLooking through:\n\nShower A: X=827,Y=610\n\nShower B: X=827,Y=610\n\nWait that can't be; perhaps a mistake in data entry. Alternatively, maybe both are at same coordinates but it's a typo and they're separate.\n\nBut the user is asking for \"a shower\" so I need to see if there are any available.\n\nFrom the provided data, I see two showers: Shower A at (827,610) with tokens Clean and Wash, and Shower B also at same coordinates but perhaps different words. Wait no, looking again:\n\nShower A: X=827,Y=610; labels: Clean, Wash\n\nShower B: X=827,Y=610; labels: Clean, Wash\n\nWait that's the same as Shower A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake and they are at different coordinates but similar entries. Or perhaps it's just one location with two showers? But I don't think so.\n\nBut in any case, based on the data provided, there is a Shower (A and B) located at X=827,Y=610.\n\nTherefore, to respond to the prompt \"I could really go for a shower,\" the appropriate action would be to suggest using one of the showers available. Since both are at the same location, perhaps it's just one place, but with two names.\n\nSo, I can direct the user to go to (827,610) and choose either Shower A or B.\n\nBut wait, looking back through the data:\n\nWait actually, in the list of waypoints, the first set after starting point is:\n\n- Room 1003 - Student Lounge at 950,613\n- Room 1002 - Office at 940,613\n- Room 1001 - Common Area at 874,613\n\nThen E5 Entrance at (1535,1535)\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait actually, in the data provided earlier, it's a list of waypoints with their names and coordinates. So let me go through each:\n\n1. Starting Location: X=874,Y=613\n\n2. Room 1003 - Student Lounge: X=950,Y=613\n   Words: 1003, Student Lounge, common area?, Office?, etc.\n\nWait no, actually the data is:\n\nList of waypoints:\n\n- Starting Location (874,613)\n- Room 1003 - Student Lounge at 950,613\n- Room 1002 - Office at 940,613\n- Room 1001 - Common Area at 874,613 (same as starting location?)\nWait that can't be. Maybe the starting location is a separate point.\n\nThen E5 Entrance and E4 Entrance are far away at (1535,1535)\n\nBut then the showers:\n\nShower A: X=827,Y=610\nShower B: X=827,Y=610\n\nWait I'm getting confused because it's hard to parse through all these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that based on the data provided, there are two showers at (827,610). Therefore, the user can go to that location and choose either shower.\n\nSo in response to \"I could really go for a shower,\" the appropriate action is to tell them to go to (827,610) and use one of the showers there.\n</think>\n\nTo address your need for a shower, you can head to the location at coordinates **(827, 610)**.
