For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, move to [[Assembly Room]], state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival, and wait for confirmation before proceeding.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user has given me a query about how to handle an advanced fuzzy matching problem with Waypoints. They've provided a lot of information, including examples and functions that need to be handled. My task is to understand their requirements clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through the input they've provided. It seems like it's structured into sections: Role, Understanding User Prompts, Advanced Fuzzy Matching for Waypoints, Handling Complex Commands, Supported Edge Cases, Examples, and then the specific prompt they want to process.\n\nThe main challenge here is understanding how to implement this fuzzy matching logic correctly. The user has detailed each step of normalization, extraneous token removal, tokenization, similarity calculation, selection, and fallback. Each of these steps needs to be carefully translated into code or a workflow that accurately reflects the described algorithm.\n\nLooking at the example prompt given: \"Robot, move to [[Assembly Room]], state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival, and wait for confirmation before proceeding.\" I can see that this is asking for two actions: navigating to the Assembly Room and then waiting. But in the previous example they provided, the response was an array of actions each with a name and input.\n\nWait, no, actually looking back at their examples, the responses were arrays where each action had \"navigate\" or \"speak\", but not \"wait\". Hmm, maybe I missed that part. Wait, no, in one of the examples they provided, the response included a \"wait\" action with an input of 10 seconds.\n\nBut looking back at their prompt now, the structure expects me to return actions as a list of objects with \"action\" and \"input\". So for this specific query, I need to parse each command step by step.\n\nFirst, the user says: \"Robot, move to [[Assembly Room]], state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival...\" This seems like two commands. The first is moving to the Assembly Room, which would be a navigate action. Then, they want to wait for confirmation before proceeding. So that's a wait action with an input of confirmation time.\n\nBut wait, do I have the exact timing? In their example, it was 10 seconds, but here there might be another variable or placeholder. Since [[Confirmation Time]] is in the prompt, maybe it's intended to use this value as part of the wait action.\n\nSo first step: Identify each command separately. The first command is navigating to the Assembly Room. I need to check if \"Assembly Room\" exists among the waypoints provided. From their Role section, the waypoints include things like RoboHub, C&D areas, shower A and B, etc., but not Assembly Room. So this would fall into an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo for the first action, since it's unknown, I need to return a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist\" as per their supported edge cases.\n\nThe second command is to wait for confirmation before proceeding. But what if the confirmation isn't found? Or perhaps they're expecting another action after that, but in this case, there are no further commands. So maybe just waiting indefinitely or until some condition.\n\nBut according to the prompt's structure, the response should be an array of actions with \"action\" and \"input\". The first action is speak because it's unknown. Then, perhaps a wait action without any input since the confirmation time isn't specified here.\n\nAlternatively, if [[Confirmation Time]] is intended to be part of the action, maybe I need to handle placeholders in some way, but that might complicate things beyond this scope.\n\nSo putting it all together: The first command leads to an unknown waypoint, so a speak action. Then, since there's no confirmation time specified in this query, perhaps just a wait action with no input or defaulting to 10 seconds as before. But the example uses [[Confirmation Time]] which is present here.\n\nWait, looking at the user prompt again: \"state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival, and wait for confirmation before proceeding.\" The \"wait\" part mentions confirming before proceeding, but since it's not specifying a time, maybe I should handle that as an unknown variable or default to 10 seconds. However, in their previous example, they used [[Confirmation Time]], which is present here.\n\nSo the actions array would have two elements: one speak for the unknown waypoint and another wait action with input as confirmation time (the placeholder). But perhaps since it's a dynamic value, I can just include it as part of the action's input.\n\nWait, but in their previous example, they had \"action\": \"wait\" with \"input\": 10. So if the confirmation time is [[Confirmation Time]], maybe that's intended to be filled in by the user or another parameter elsewhere.\n\nBut for now, since I don't have access to external data or variables, perhaps I can structure it as a wait action with input as [[Confirmation Time]].\n\nSo overall, my response would include two actions: one speak because the waypoint is unknown, and then a wait action using the placeholder variable.\n</think>\n\nTo address this problem, we'll break down each command step by step:\n\n1. **Move to [[Assembly Room]]**: \n   - This requires navigating to \"Assembly Room.\"\n   - Check if \"Assembly Room\" exists among the waypoints.\n\n2. **State 'Assembly Room' upon arrival**:\n   - Confirm that the robot is at \"Assembly Room.\"\n\n3. **Wait for confirmation before proceeding**:\n   - Determine a suitable waiting time or condition based on confirmation.\n\n### Solution Code:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"speak\",\n    \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"wait\",\n    \"input\": \"[[Confirmation Time]]\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Unknown Waypoint Handling**:\n   - The first command to navigate to \"Assembly Room\" is unknown based on the provided waypoints.\n   - Therefore, a `speak` action is triggered with a message indicating the waypoint does not exist.\n\n2. **Waiting for Confirmation**:\n   - After confirming the robot's arrival at \"Assembly Room,\" the second command involves waiting for confirmation before proceeding.\n   - The waiting time is specified as `[[(Confirmation Time)]]`, which can be replaced with an actual value or placeholder depending on implementation needs.\n\nThis structured approach ensures each part of the user's prompt is processed correctly, handling unknown waypoints and placeholders appropriately.",
