    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wate 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" First, I'll break it down into smaller parts.\n\nThe user seems to want a sequence of actions: first take them to Shower A, then to Shower B. After that, they want to wait for one minute at Shower B before proceeding further.\n\nI remember from the examples provided earlier that when there are multiple steps, each step is translated into an action in order. So, I should process this as three separate actions: navigate to Shower A, navigate to Shower B, and then wait for a minute at Shower B.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the waypisons \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" actually exist. Looking back at the list of waypoints provided:\n\n- Shower B exists with coordinates (827, 610), but there's no mention of \"Shower A\". So, that might be an issue.\n\nAlso, in the prompt, after waiting at Shower B for a minute, it says \"then we can go.\" The user doesn't specify where to go next, so maybe that part is optional or unclear. But since the focus is on handling the given steps up until Shower B, I'll proceed with the actions that are possible.\n\nSince \"Shower A\" isn't listed, the navigation command would result in an unknown waypoint action. Then moving to \"Shower B\" should work as it exists. After arriving at Shower B, waiting for a minute is straightforward.\n\nI also need to make sure about the commands: after waiting, there's no specified destination, so perhaps that part isn't included or needs clarification. But according to the prompt, they just want to wait and then presumably proceed further on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure three actions:\n1. Navigate to Shower B (if available) but wait, in the list provided, Shower B is actually named \"Shower B\", so that's correct.\nWait, no\u2014the waypisons are:\n\n- Shower B: X=827, Y=610.\n\nSo in the user prompt, they first go to \"Shower A\" which isn't a waypoint. So for the first action, it would be an unknown waypoint and result in a speak action saying that 'Shower A' doesn't exist.\n\nSecond action: navigate to Shower B as it exists.\n\nThird action: wait for 1 minute at Shower B.\n\nI think that's how it should go.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the user prompt effectively, we'll follow a structured approach:\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Identify Waypoints:** \n   - The user mentions \"Shower A\" which doesn't exist in our list of waypoints. Therefore, attempting to navigate to \"Shower A\" will result in an unknown waypoint action.\n   \n2. **Navigate to Existing Waypoint:**\n   - The second part of the prompt is to go to \"Shower B\", which exists with coordinates (827, 610). This will be a successful navigate action.\n\n3. **Wait at Shower B:**\n   - After arriving at Shower B, wait for 1 minute as per the user's instruction.\n\n**Final Actions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Shower A' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that each part of the user's request is processed, handling unknown waypoints appropriately.",
