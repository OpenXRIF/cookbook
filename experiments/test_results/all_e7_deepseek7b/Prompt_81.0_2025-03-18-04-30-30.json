    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the command. It seems like two main actions are required: navigating to \"c&d\" (which I assume is Coffee Area) to get a coffee and then going to the Design Team Bay. \n\nBut wait, before anything, I should check if these waypoints exist in our list of known locations. From the data provided, the known waypoints include things like Ideas Clinic, RoboHub, various labs (like Lab 108), some showers, and others, but I don't see \"c&d\" or \"Design Team Bay\" listed. \n\nSo, according to the rules, if a waypoint isn't found, we should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the message that it doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way to interpret this differently. Could \"c&d\" stand for something else? Like a coordinate range or a specific area code? The example prompts didn't have such commands, so I think it's safe to assume it refers to an existing waypoint.\n\nSince neither of these waypoints exists, the fallback rule applies where we need to return the speak action. \n\nI should also make sure that there are no other possible interpretations. Maybe \"c&d\" is a typo for something else or part of another waypoint name? Looking back at the known waypoints: Ideas, RoboHub, Lab 108, etc., but nothing matches \"c&d\".\n\nSo yes, both steps involve waypoints that don't exist in our system.\n\nTherefore, the response should be to speak that both the Coffee Area and Design Team Bay are unknown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'c&d' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Design Team Bay' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
