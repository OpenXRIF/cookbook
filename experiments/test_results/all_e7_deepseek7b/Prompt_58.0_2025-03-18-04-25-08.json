    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the starting point, it's (0.0, 0.0). The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So, the user is asking for a navigation action but also providing a waypoint name in their input. \n\nThe prompt mentions \"E7 silent study.\" I need to check if this is a known waypoint from the provided list. Scanning through the waypoints:\n\n- E1 Coffee Area\n- E2 Meeting Room\n- E3 Lounge\n- E4 Lab\n- E5 Storage\n- E6 Training Room\n- E7 Silent Study\n\nYes, E7 Silent Study exists with coordinates X: 0.0, Y: 0.0. So the user is requesting navigation to this specific location.\n\nNext, according to the handling complex commands section, I should process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless told otherwise. Since there's only one command here, it's straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the normalization step for fuzzy matching, but since E7 Silent Study is already exactly present, no need for that processing.\n\nTokenization isn't necessary here because \"E7 silent study\" directly matches the known waypoint name after trimming and removing any extraneous tokens. In this case, both the user's input and the waypoint name match perfectly when processed.\n\nSo, based on all these steps, the appropriate action is to navigate to E7 Silent Study at (0.0, 0.0). No need for speak or wait actions since there are none mentioned in the prompt.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Waypoint**: The user mentions \"E7 silent study.\" From the available waypoints, this corresponds to E7 Silent Study at coordinates (0.0, 0.0).\n\n2. **Navigate**: Since there are no additional commands after navigation, a single navigate action is sufficient.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E7 - Silent Study\",\n                \"x\": 0,\n                \"y\": 0\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
