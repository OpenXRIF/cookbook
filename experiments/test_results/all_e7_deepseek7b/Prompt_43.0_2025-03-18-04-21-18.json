    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break down what's required step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for navigation. They mentioned a specific waypoint called \"E7 silent study.\" I remember looking through the provided waypoints earlier and noticed that E7 isn't listed in the available names. The list of waypoints includes things like Ideas Clinic, RoboHub Entrance, different Coffee Areas (A, B, C, D), Study Areas (C, D), and some other locations.\n\nSince \"E7 silent study\" isn't among the known waypoints, I need to handle this according to the instructions given. When an unknown waypoint is detected, the function should return an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and provide an error message stating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to make sure not to include any unnecessary tokens or prefixes when generating the response. The speaking action should be straightforward, just pointing out the missing waypoint without any extra information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct output would be a single speak action with an input message informing the user that \"E7 silent study\" isn't available.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: E7 silent study.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
