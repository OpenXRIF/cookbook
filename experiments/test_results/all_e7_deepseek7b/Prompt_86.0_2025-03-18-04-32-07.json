    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the user's prompt is asking the robot to navigate to the C&D - Hot Food Area and then wait for 15 seconds. \n\nFirst, I need to parse this command. It seems like there are two main parts: moving to a specific location and waiting for a certain duration.\n\nLooking at the structure, \"navigate\" would be the action for moving, and \"wait\" is for waiting. The input specifies both the destination and the time to wait. \n\nI should check if C&D - Hot Food Area exists as a waypoint. If it does, then I can create an action for navigating there. Then, after arriving, the robot needs to wait for 15 seconds.\n\nIf for some reason that waypoint isn't found, I'll have to return an error message saying the zone doesn't exist and instruct the robot to speak accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's command effectively, we need to break it down into two actions: navigating to the specified location and waiting at that location for a given duration.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Actions Needed:**  \n   - The primary action is \"navigate\" to move to the target location.\n   - A secondary action is required to \"wait\" at the target location for 15 seconds.\n\n2. **Determine the Input Parameters for Navigation:**  \n   - The destination name is \"C&D - Hot Food Area\".\n   - Assuming this waypoint exists, we can use it directly. If not, an error message will be returned.\n\n3. **Construct the Navigation Action:**  \n   - Use the identified destination as the waypoint.\n   - Ensure that all components (e.g., C&D) are correctly mapped to the waypoint name.\n\n4. **Construct the Wait Action:**  \n   - The wait duration is 15 seconds, which should be specified in the \"wait\" action.\n\n**Final Actions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 15\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf the waypoint \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" does not exist, an error message will be returned indicating that the zone is unknown.",
