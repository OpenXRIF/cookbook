For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need to freshen up. Take me two Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this user prompt that says, \"I need to freshen up. Take me two Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for some action involving showering twice and waiting. I remember from the examples that when they ask for something specific like keys or an entrance, it translates into navigation actions with coordinates. So, I'll need to figure out where Shower A and Shower B are located based on the given waypoints.\n\nLooking at the provided data, I see two showers: Shower A is at (616) and Shower B at (616). Wait, actually, looking back, no, let me check again. The user prompt mentions \"Shower A\" with coordinates 616, which in the list of waypoints is shown as \"Shower A are Clean, Wash, 1918.\" Hmm, maybe that's a typo or perhaps a different way to reference it. Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nWait, in the provided data under Waypoints, I see:\n\n- Shower A: X=616\n- Shower B: X=616\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, in the given waypoints, for \"Shower A\" it's at (616), and \"Shower B\" is also at 616. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake? Or perhaps both are at the same location.\n\nBut wait, no, let me look carefully:\n\nUnder the provided list of waypoints, I see:\n\n- Shower A: X=616\n- Shower B: No direct entry in the user prompt, but under the data section, I have:\n\nWait, hold on. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nThe user mentions \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B.\" Looking at the provided waypoints, for \"Shower A,\" it's listed as:\n\n\"Shower A are Clean, Wash, 1918.\"\n\nBut in the data section, I see:\n\n- Shower A: X=616\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nUnder the list of waypoints, each entry has a name and coordinates. For example, \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" is at (x: ?, y: ?). Similarly, under the data section, I see:\n\n- Shower A: X=616\nWait, no. Looking again, actually, in the provided waypoints list, each entry has a name and coordinates like Room 1427 etc., but when I look for \"Shower A,\" it's just text with tokens but no specific coordinate.\n\nWait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check:\n\nIn the user prompt, they say \"Take me two Shower A, then Shower B.\"\n\nBut looking at the waypoints list provided, the only entries that mention \"Shower\" are:\n\n- Shower A: Clean, Wash, 1918\n- Shower B: Clean, Wash, 1918\n\nWait, no. Looking again, I realize perhaps they were mistakenly labeled as different locations. Or maybe in the data section, each entry has a name and coordinate.\n\nWait, let's parse this correctly:\n\nThe user prompt refers to \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B.\" But in the provided waypoints list, under the data section, for example:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic is at x=25, y=75\n- E5 Entrance: x=1535, y=1535\n\nBut looking back to the user's prompt, they have \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B.\" However, in the data section under waypoints, I don't see entries for Shower A or Shower B with coordinates. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait no, let me check again:\n\nIn the provided list of waypoints, each entry has a name like \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" at specific x and y coordinates. However, the user prompt mentions \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B,\" but in the data section, I don't see any entries for these names with coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the user is trying to refer to some other showers that aren't listed here. Since the data doesn't have specific coordinates for Shower A or Shower B, according to the given waypoints, they might be considered unknown zones.\n\nTherefore, when the user says \"Take me two Shower A,\" since there's no known waypoint for Shower A (as per the provided list), it would fall under the unknown waypoint category. Same with Shower B.\n\nIn the example given by the user in their prompt, they end up having to ask about an unknown zone and then a RoboHub. So following that logic, if \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" are not listed as waypoints, they would be considered unknown.\n\nSo, translating the user's instructions into actions:\n\n1. Take me two times to Shower A (unknown) \u2192 Unknown waypoint twice.\n2. Then go to Shower B (unknown) \u2192 Unknown waypoint once.\n3. Wait 1 minute at Shower B \u2192 Maybe require waiting before navigating again? Or just wait in place.\n\nBut since both showers are unknown, the system can't navigate there. So the response would need to inform that these locations aren't recognized and suggest alternative actions or provide options for the user to specify where they want to go.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"Shower A\" is a typo or refers to an existing location I haven't noticed. Let me double-check the provided waypoints list again.\n\nLooking back at the data section:\n\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic: x=?, y=?\n- Ideas Clinic: same as above\n- Other entries like E5 Entrance, etc., but no showers with coordinates listed except perhaps for their token names without x,y.\n\nSo, \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" are not present in the data section. Therefore, they're unknown.\n\nHence, the action would involve:\n\n1. Take me to an unknown location twice.\n2. Then go to another unknown location once.\n3. Wait 1 minute at that unknown location.\n\nBut since the system can't navigate to unknown locations, it's impossible to execute these steps. So perhaps the user needs to provide more specific instructions or confirm where they want to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" are actually referring to Room 616? Because in the initial data section, under \"Room 616,\" it's listed as:\n\n\"Shower A: Clean, Wash, 1918\"\n\nWait, no. Looking again, in the list of waypoints, each entry is a room or location with its x,y coordinates except for the ones like \"Shower A.\" So perhaps \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" are not actual rooms but just tokens without coordinates.\n\nIn that case, when the user says \"Take me two Shower A,\" since there's no known waypoint named Shower A (as per the data), it's considered an unknown zone. Same for Shower B.\n\nSo, in response to the user prompt:\n\n\"I need to freshen up. Take me two Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"\n\nThe system would first recognize that \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" are unknown waypoints because they're not listed in the provided data section. Therefore, it's impossible to navigate there.\n\nHowever, since the user is asking for actions involving these showers, perhaps the response should inform them of this issue and ask if they meant a specific known location or need help with something else.\n</think>\n\nThe user's request involves locations that are not recognized in the provided data section. Specifically, \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" do not correspond to any known waypoints. Here's how we can address their request:\n\n1. **Unknown Locations**: Since \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\" are not listed as known waypoints, they cannot be navigated to.\n2. **Request Clarification**: The system should inform the user that these locations are unknown and ask if they meant a specific location or need assistance with something else.\n\n**Response:**\n\n\"I'm sorry, I couldn't find any known waypoint named 'Shower A' or 'Shower B.' Could you clarify if you meant a different location or if there's something else you'd like to do?\"",
