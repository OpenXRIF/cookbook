For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Experiment ID": 12.0,
    "Prompt ID": 81.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to process this prompt: \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the starting location is at (0.0, 0.0). The user wants to go to the c&d area first. I remember from the list of waypoints that there are several options like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Design Team Bay, etc. Since \"c&d\" might refer to any of these areas.\n\nThe prompt says to ask for a coffee in the c&d and then go to the design team bay. So I think it's asking to go into the c&d area (probably Coffee), get something (coffee), and then proceed to the Design Team Bay, which is another waypoint.\n\nBut wait, looking at the list, \"C&D - Design Team Bay\" is a separate location with its own coordinates. So after getting coffee in C&D, I should navigate there and then move towards the Design Team Bay.\n\nI also need to make sure about the functions available: navigate, speak, and wait. Since the user is giving commands step by step, it's likely that each action requires navigation. There's no mention of needing to speak here unless to inform something, but the examples show that when you're moving between waypoints, you don't necessarily need to speak unless there's a specific instruction.\n\nSo first, navigate to C&D - Coffee Area with coordinates (x: 100, y: 100). Then from there, probably move towards Design Team Bay at (x: 25, y: 50). Since the Design Team Bay is another waypoint, maybe it's located near the RoboHub but within C&D.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, \"C&D - Design Team Bay\" might already be a specific point in the building. So perhaps after getting coffee, just navigate directly to Design Team Bay's coordinates without needing to wait or speak unless necessary for confirmation.\n\nI should structure this as two actions: first navigating to C&D Coffee Area and then to Design Team Bay.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's request, we will process each action step by step:\n\n1. **Navigate** to C&D - Coffee Area at (x: 100, y: 100).\n2. Then **navigate** to Design Team Bay at (x: 25, y: 50).\n\nHere is the structured response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Design Team Bay\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
