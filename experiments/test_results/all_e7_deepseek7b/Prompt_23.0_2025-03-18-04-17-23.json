The task is to navigate to the Ideas Clinic first and then proceed to the Assemble Room.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if both waypoints exist. Looking at the provided list, I see that there's no entry for the Ideas Clinic. It only mentions places like C&D Coffee Area, Shower B, etc. So, the Ideas Clinic is an unknown waypoint.\n\nNext, since one of the required waypoints doesn't exist, according to the handling complex commands section, if any waypoint is unknown, we should output a speak action with an error message. The error message in the example for an unknown zone was \"This waypoint does not exist,\" so following that pattern here would be appropriate.\n\nI don't need to consider the Assemble Room because once the first waypoint isn't found, there's no point in proceeding further since navigation commands depend on valid waypoints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: Ideas Clinic\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
