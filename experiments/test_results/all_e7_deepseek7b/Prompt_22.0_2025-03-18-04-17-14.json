    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants me to handle this prompt where they're asking to go from the current location (0.0, 0.0) to two specific waypoints: \"Silent Study\" and then to \"RoboHub\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the prompt correctly. They've mentioned two destinations after the actions, so it looks like a sequence of navigate commands.\n\nI should check if both \"Silent Study\" and \"RoboHub\" are valid waypoints from my list. Let me see:\n\n- Silent Study: Yes, it's listed as a waypoint at X=200, Y=150.\n- RoboHub: Wait, looking through the waypoints, I don't see any named \"RoboHub\". There is \"Robo Hub Entrance\" but that's just an entrance area. Hmm, maybe there's no direct waypoint called \"RoboHub\".\n\nSo for the second part of the prompt, since there's no known waypoint named RoboHub, I should respond with a speak action indicating it doesn't exist.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions would be navigate to Silent Study and then speak about RoboHub not existing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Silent Study\",\n        \"x\": 200,\n        \"y\": 150\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: RoboHub\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
