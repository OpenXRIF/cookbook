    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's a known waypoint named \"E7 Silent Study\" in the provided list. Looking through the list of waypoints:\n\n- There are mentions of \"Ideas Clinic\", \"RoboHub Entrance\", and some shower areas like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" but nothing called E7 Silent Study.\n\nSo, since it's not listed, I should return an action that says this waypoint doesn't exist. According to the instructions, if no known waypoint meets the threshold (which is set at 80% similarity), we output a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. The user said \"E7 silent study\". I should check if any of the existing waypoints have something similar to E7 in their name or location.\n\nLooking through again:\n\n- There are mentions like \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" and \"RoboHub Entrance\". No E7 anywhere.\n\nSo, no matches found. Therefore, the response should be a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
