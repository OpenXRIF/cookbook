    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to help the user with their prompt. The query is about the user wanting to go to a place where they're feeling peckish and then grab a drink. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user mentions \"C&D\" which likely stands for Coffee & Dice or something similar in the context of RoboHub areas. They mention going by the Snack Area and then grabbing a drink at the Cold Drink Area. So, I need to check if these are valid waypoints.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided:\n\n- There's a \"C&D - Coffee Area\" with X:100, Y:100.\n- Then, there's another \"C&D - Snack Area\" at X:200, Y:150 and \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\" at X:300, Y:200.\n\nSo both the snack area and drink area are valid. The user wants to go to both places in sequence after expressing feeling peckish.\n\nI should construct an action plan that first navigates to the Snack Area, then to the Cold Drink Area. That makes sense because they're both part of the same C&D complex but different areas.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Navigate to \"C&D - Snack Area\" at (200,150).\n2. Then navigate again to \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\" at (300,200).\n\nI need to make sure these are valid actions and that there's no issue with moving between them. Since the user didn't mention waiting or anything else, just navigating twice in sequence should suffice.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required JSON format, I'll have an array of two action objects: first navigate to the snack area, then navigate again to the drink area.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Snack Area\",\n        \"x\": 200,\n        \"y\": 150\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\",\n        \"x\": 300,\n        \"y\": 200\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
