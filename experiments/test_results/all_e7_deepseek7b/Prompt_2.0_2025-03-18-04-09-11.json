    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt is: \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\" \n\nFirst, let me break it down. The user wants me to navigate to two specific waypoints in sequence. Let's see what each of these waypoints entails.\n\nThe first destination mentioned is the Ideas Clinic. Looking at the list of available waypoints provided earlier, I need to check if there's a known waypoint named \"Ideas Clinic\". Scanning through the list... Hmm, yes, there's an entry for \"Ideas Clinic\" with coordinates (25,75). So that seems straightforward.\n\nNext up is the Assembly Room. Now, looking at the waypoints, none of them are exactly called \"Assembly Room\". There's one waypoint named \"C&D - Assembly Room\" which matches perfectly because C&D is a code often used for areas like Coffee and Dairy or something similar, so that must be it. The coordinates for this are (1427, 35).\n\nSo the user wants me to first go to the Ideas Clinic at (25,75) and then proceed to the Assembly Room at (1427,35). \n\nNow, considering the available functions: navigate, speak, wait. The prompt is a series of two navigation commands without any need for speaking or waiting in between. So I don't think there's any ambiguity here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if both waypoints are correctly identified and exist in the list. Yes, Ideas Clinic exists as (25,75), and C&D - Assembly Room is at (1427,35). \n\nThere's no mention of needing to wait or speak in between these actions because the user just provided a sequence of navigation commands.\n\nSo the plan is: first navigate to the Ideas Clinic with the given coordinates, then immediately navigate again to the Assembly Room from there. There's no need for any additional steps since it's a direct instruction without any stopover points mentioned.\n\nI don't see any unknown waypoints here because both are present in the list. So I can proceed confidently without needing fallback actions like \"speak\" or error messages.\n\nPutting it all together, the action would be to first navigate to Ideas Clinic and then from there, navigate again to Assembly Room.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": 1427,\n        \"y\": 35\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
