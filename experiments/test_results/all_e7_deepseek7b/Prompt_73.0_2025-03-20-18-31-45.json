For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"I could really go for a shower.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the user's prompt step by step to figure out what to do. The prompt is, \"I could really go for a shower.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify any waypoints that might be relevant here. From the list provided, there are several shower areas: Shower A and Shower B in the East Side, and a generic \"Shower\" entry at the starting location (874, 613). \n\nThe user mentions wanting to \"go for a shower,\" which likely refers to taking a shower, so they might be looking for one of these specific showers. The starting point's shower is already available, so maybe that's an option.\n\nNext, I'll consider the functions allowed: navigate, speak, and wait. Since the user isn't giving commands but expressing a desire, perhaps they just want to take a shower without any action needed beyond location info or confirmation.\n\nLooking at the waypoint names, \"Shower A\" is located at 951,616, which might be nearby from the starting point (874,613). The distance isn't too far, so maybe that's accessible. Alternatively, the generic Shower at (874,613) could be immediately available.\n\nI don't see any need for navigation commands because the user isn't directing someone else; they're expressing a personal desire to take a shower. Therefore, no navigate action is required unless they want to confirm their location or move somewhere else after taking a shower, but that's not indicated here.\n\nSince there are valid waypoints related to showers and none of them require complex commands beyond what's provided, the best approach would be to output an action that allows the user to know where the nearest shower is. \n\nIn this case, the appropriate action would probably involve navigating to one of these showers. However, since the prompt doesn't specify a destination after taking the shower or any need for further actions, the minimal response might just be confirming their location.\n\nBut looking back at the supported edge cases, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, we output an action with \"speak\" and inform that it's unknown. But wait, in this case, there are known waypoints (Shower A, Shower B, and the starting shower). So, the user isn't referencing a specific one; they're just saying they could go for a shower.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to output an action confirming their location near a shower or directing them to take a shower. Since the prompt doesn't specify needing further actions like moving elsewhere after taking a shower, maybe we can just confirm that there's a shower available nearby without any movement required.\n\nAlternatively, if they're at the starting point and want to take a shower right there, then navigating to (874,613) makes sense. But since they didn't specify where exactly, it's safer to assume they are considering taking a shower in general and perhaps would need confirmation of their location or nearby availability.\n\nBut following the instructions strictly: if multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score. The starting point's shower is already at (874,613), which matches exactly with the user's possible intent to take a shower from there.\n\nSo, the action would involve navigating to that location.\n</think>\n\nTo address the prompt \"I could really go for a shower,\" we need to determine if there are any known waypoints related to taking a shower. From the list provided, there are several options:\n\n1. **Shower A**: Located at (951, 616)\n2. **Shower B**: Located at (874, 613) - this is the starting location.\n3. **Generic Shower**: Located at the starting point (874, 613)\n\nSince the prompt does not specify a destination after taking the shower or any need for further actions, the minimal response would be to navigate to one of these showers if needed. However, since no specific action is required beyond expressing an intent to take a shower, we can confirm their location.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Starting Location\",\n        \"x\": 874,\n        \"y\": 613\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
