    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this user prompt: \"There's no good coffee here. Don't go to the C&D.\" I need to figure out what action to take based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, let me break down the input. The user is talking about not going to the C&D area because there's no good coffee. So, they're referring to a place called \"C&D\". From the waypoint list provided earlier, I see that there are waypoints named like \"Coffee Area\", but none exactly called \"C&D - Coffee Area\". \n\nLooking at the available functions: navigate, speak, and wait. The user isn't asking for navigation directions or commands; they're giving a directive. So maybe \"speak\" is appropriate here.\n\nThe instructions say that if it's an unknown waypoint, we should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the message about the waypoint not existing. Since \"C&D\" isn't listed as any known waypoint in the provided data, I can assume that's the case.\n\nWait, but is there a chance that \"C&D\" might refer to a combination of two areas or maybe it's an abbreviation for another waypoint? From the list given earlier, none of the waypoints are named C&D. So, it's safe to treat this as an unknown waypoint.\n\nTherefore, I should respond with a speak action informing the user about the unknown waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"I don't recognize 'C&D' as a known waypoint.
