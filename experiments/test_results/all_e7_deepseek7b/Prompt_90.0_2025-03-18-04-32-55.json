    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt using the provided guidelines. The prompt says: \"Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the user is asking for. They want a robot to perform two actions: navigate to a specific location and then announce something at that location.\n\nLooking at the supported functions, we have \"navigate\" and \"announce\". Since both are supported, I don't need to worry about an unsupported action error here.\n\nThe navigation part requires finding the waypoint name \"C&D - Hot Food Area\". From the list provided, I see that there's a waypoint called \"C&D - Coffee Area\", but that's not what we're looking for. Hmm, it seems like the user might have meant something slightly different or perhaps a typo in the waypoint names.\n\nWait, maybe \"Hot Food Area\" isn't listed among the waypoints. Let me check again. Scanning through the list... Nope, I don't see any entry for \"C&D - Hot Food Area\". There's another area called \"C&D - Coffee Area\", but that's different. So, it seems like this waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nIf a waypoint isn't found during normalization and matching, according to the guidelines, we should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input stating that the waypoint doesn't exist. But in this case, since the user is also asking for an \"announce\" command, I need to ensure both actions are addressed.\n\nBut wait, the \"navigate\" function can be applied if there's a matching or fallback waypoint, but if the waypoint isn't found, we have to output a speak action. So, after trying to navigate and finding no waypoint, the robot should speak that it doesn't exist. However, since the user is also asking for an announcement, which likely requires knowing the location name.\n\nBut without a valid waypoint, announcing wouldn't make sense because there's nowhere to announce. So perhaps in this case, both actions can be handled by first trying to navigate and then speaking if navigation fails.\n\nPutting it all together: The robot would attempt to navigate to \"C&D - Hot Food Area\". Since it doesn't exist, it will perform a speak action informing the user that the waypoint isn't available. Then, since the announcement command is part of the prompt, but without a valid location, maybe we can just include both actions as per the prompt's instructions.\n\nBut according to the handling complex commands section, if multiple steps are involved, output the actions in the order they should be executed. So first navigate, then speak. However, since navigating fails, only the speak action will execute successfully, and the navigate part is ignored or results in an error.\n\nTherefore, the final actions list would contain a single speak action with the message about the missing waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: C&D - Hot Food Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
