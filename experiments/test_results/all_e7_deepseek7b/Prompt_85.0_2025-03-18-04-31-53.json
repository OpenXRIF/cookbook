    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this prompt from the user: \"Robot, go to North Entrance and wait for 15 minutes.\" Hmm, let's see how to handle this. \n\nFirst off, I know that the robot has three available actions: navigate, speak, and wait. The task here seems like a combination of moving to a location and then waiting. So maybe it's two separate steps.\n\nThe prompt mentions going to the North Entrance first. But looking at the list of waypoints provided earlier, I don't see any waypoint named \"North Entrance.\" There are places like Starting Locations at (0.0, 0.0), but that's just where they start. Then there's the Robot Hub, which is probably a point for communication, maybe at (100, 50) or something similar, but not called North Entrance.\n\nSo if I can't find \"North Entrance,\" according to the edge cases, I have to return an action that says it doesn't exist. That would be a speak action with the message about the unknown waypoint. But wait, in this prompt, the user is asking the robot to go there and then wait for 15 minutes.\n\nSo maybe first, try to find \"North Entrance.\" If it's not found, output the speak action. Then, perhaps if that fails, do something else? Or maybe since the prompt includes a command after moving, I have to process both parts.\n\nBut according to the examples given, when there are unknown waypoints or commands, the robot should return an error message with just one action. So in this case, even though the user is asking for two actions (navigate and wait), because \"North Entrance\" isn't a known waypoint, it's best to output just the speak action saying that it doesn't exist.\n\nI guess I'm overcomplicating it. The main point is that if any part of the prompt refers to an unknown waypoint or command, the response should be an error message with just one speak action. So regardless of the wait part, since \"North Entrance\" isn't in the list, the robot can't proceed and must respond accordingly.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to output a single action where it speaks about the unknown waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: North Entrance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
