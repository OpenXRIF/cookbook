    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" My task is to process this command according to the guidelines given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the commands. The example responses show that actions are processed in order unless multiple steps are required, which should be executed sequentially. Also, if there's ambiguity or unknown waypoints, it falls back to a speak action with an error message.\n\nLooking at the prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"\n\nBreaking this down, it seems like two actions are needed:\n1. Navigate to the E5 Entrance.\n2. After arriving there, navigate to the Microwaves.\n\nNow, I need to check if these are known waypoints. The list of available waypoints includes various locations like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, Shower B, etc., but it doesn't mention E5 or Microwaves.\n\nSince both \"E5 Entrance\" and \"Microwaves\" aren't listed as known waypoints, the system should return a speak action indicating that these are unknown waypoints. However, since there are two steps required, I need to consider how this fits into the supported edge cases.\n\nThe user is requesting two actions in sequence: navigate to E5 Entrance first and then find Microwaves. But if both are unknown, each step would result in a speak action with an error message for each waypoint. However, according to the examples provided, when multiple steps involve known or unknown waypoints, it's better to return just one speak action mentioning that all requested points are unknown.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement under Handling Complex Commands: \"For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed. If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\"\n\nIn this case, since both steps involve unknown waypoints, each would require a speak action. But according to the supported edge cases, when an unknown waypoint is encountered and no other known waypoints are implied, the system returns one speak action stating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, even though there are two actions required, since both waypoints are unknown, it's appropriate to return a single speak action indicating that both points don't exist. This aligns with the supported edge case where no known waypoints meet the threshold and an action is returned as per the first unknown waypoint.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the response should be a single speak action informing the user that the E5 Entrance and Microwaves are not available.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E5 Entrance' is not a valid waypoint.
