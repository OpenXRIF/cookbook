    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt. The command is: \"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\" \n\nFirst, let me break this down. The user wants two things: move to a specific location called Assembly Room and then say \"Assembly Room\" when they get there. I know that in our system, we have functions like navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nSo, the first part is moving to Assembly Room. That sounds straightforward; I can create an action where the robot navigates to that waypoint. But wait, does the Assembly Room exist? Looking back at the list of waypoints, yes, it's there with coordinates (951, 616). So that should be fine.\n\nThe second part is stating \"Assembly Room\" upon arrival. That means after arriving, I need a speak action to say the name of the waypoint. \n\nI also notice that in their example prompt earlier, when moving to a waypoints and then doing another action like speaking, they structured it as two separate actions: navigate first, then speak. So following that structure makes sense.\n\nNow, checking if there are any edge cases here. The user is referring to \"Assembly Room\" but spelled without quotes, so I assume it's the correct name in our list. Also, since both actions (navigate and speak) are supported functions, we don't have any issues with unsupported actions here.\n\nI should make sure that each action is properly formatted as per the examples provided. Each action should be an object within a \"actions\" array, containing the \"action\" type and its input parameters.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create two actions: one for navigating to Assembly Room and another for speaking after arrival.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": 951,\n        \"y\": 616\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Assembly Room\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
