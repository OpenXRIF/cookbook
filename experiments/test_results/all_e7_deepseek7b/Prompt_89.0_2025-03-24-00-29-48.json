For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt. The instruction says, \"Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" So the robot needs to navigate to the North Entrance and then speak that name.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the command. It seems like there are two main actions: moving to the waypoint and speaking at it. The user wants the robot to go to the North Entrance first. Once there, after arriving, the robot should say \"North Entrance\" out loud.\n\nI'll check if the North Entrance is a known waypoint. Looking through the list provided, I see that the North Entrance has specific coordinates: X-Coordinate 0.0 and Y-Coordinate 0.0 in this case? Wait, no, looking back at the waypoints, there's a starting location at (0.0, 0.0), but the North Entrance isn't listed as one of the waypoints provided earlier. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check again. The list includes Starting Locations: X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0. So perhaps that's a placeholder and not an actual waypoint. Then, looking at the waypoints:\n\n- There are several named C&D areas, RoboHub, E5 Entrance, etc., but no specific North Entrance mentioned unless it's part of the building's structure.\n\nAssuming the North Entrance is intended to be a waypoint with coordinates (0.0, 0.0), then the robot can navigate there. But since the starting location is also at (0.0, 0.0), navigating to that point would mean staying in place but needing to say \"North Entrance\" out loud.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to use a different waypoint named North Entrance with specific coordinates elsewhere, but it's not listed here. In this case, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the North Entrance is reachable and has its own name as a waypoint.\n\nSo, first action: navigate to \"North Entrance\" at (0.0, 0.0). Second action: speak \"North Entrance\".\n\nI need to ensure that these actions are correctly ordered and don't conflict. Since moving to (0.0, 0.0) is the starting point, perhaps the robot doesn't need to move but just needs to perform the speaking action.\n\nAlternatively, if North Entrance has its own coordinates different from the starting location, then the robot would have to navigate there first before speaking.\n\nBut given that in the provided waypoints, only specific ones are listed, and since (0.0, 0.0) is the starting point, maybe the North Entrance isn't a waypoint yet or it's the same as the start. Therefore, perhaps the intended action is just to say \"North Entrance\" at the current location.\n\nIn that case, the robot can speak without moving.\n\nSo the actions would be:\n\n1. speak with input: \"North Entrance\"\n\nBut wait, the instruction says \"proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" So it's more like a navigate followed by speaking.\n\nSince the starting point is (0.0, 0.0), if the North Entrance is also at that point, then navigating there doesn't require any movement but just being present. Then the robot can perform the speak action.\n\nAlternatively, if the North Entrance has different coordinates, which are not listed here, the robot would need to navigate first.\n\nBut since no specific waypoint named \"North Entrance\" is provided in the list except for starting location, I'll assume that the user intended it as a waypoints name. So perhaps the robot can directly perform the speak action from the start point.\n\nTherefore, the actions would be:\n\n- speak with input: \"North Entrance\"\n\nAlternatively, if movement is required but not specified, maybe just proceed to speak.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"North Entrance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
