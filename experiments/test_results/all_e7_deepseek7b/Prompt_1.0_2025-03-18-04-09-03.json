    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The prompt says, \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down into two main steps: going to the North Entrance and then moving to the C&D - Main Entrance.\n\nI remember from the examples that each step should be handled as a separate action. So, I should create two navigate actions for this prompt.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Go to the North Entrance.\" The waypoint name is straightforward\u2014it's already given as \"North Entrance\" and presumably has coordinates provided. So, I'll map that directly into an action.\n\nNext, after arriving at the North Entrance, the user wants to proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance. This means I need another navigate action for that location. Again, assuming the coordinates are available or will be provided as part of the input.\n\nI should make sure each action is properly formatted with the correct structure: name and x/y coordinates. Also, since these are two separate steps, they'll be executed in order left-to-right without any backtracking needed unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nSo, I think the response should include both navigate actions in sequence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n        \"x\": X,\n        \"y\": Y\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Main Entrance\",\n        \"x\": A,\n        \"y\": B\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
