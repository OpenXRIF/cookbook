For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, according to the instructions, when processing commands, we have to follow them in a left-to-right sequence unless told otherwise. So the first part is starting at the South Entrance. Then moving towards the Coffee Area.\n\nI remember from the examples that sometimes they include actions like navigate and speak. But looking at the prompt, it's more about movement than communication, so maybe just navigation?\n\nWait, let me think again. The user says to start at one place and go to another. So the first action should be navigating to the South Entrance. But in the examples provided earlier, when someone asks for something like picking up from a certain area and dropping it off elsewhere, they specify both waypoints.\n\nIn this case, though, there's no mention of an item or anything else\u2014it's just starting at one point and moving towards another. So perhaps the main action is to navigate directly to the Coffee Area without any intermediate steps?\n\nWait, but the prompt says \"start at\" South Entrance and then go to Coffee Area. So maybe I need to first locate the user at the South Entrance? Or does that mean we start from their current position and move towards the Coffee Area?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's just a matter of navigating directly from wherever they are (assumed starting point) to the Coffee Area.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, when someone says \"can you pick something up from area A and drop it off at area B,\" both areas need to be navigated. But in this case, since there's no mention of carrying anything or any intermediate actions, maybe just moving directly is enough.\n\nWait a minute, but according to the supported edge cases, if an unknown waypoint is mentioned, we have to return that it doesn't exist and output a speak action. So first, do I need to check if both the starting point and destination are valid?\n\nSo let's list out all known waypoints from the provided data:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area (x: 100, y: 100)\n- C&D - Design Teams\n- C&D - East Entrance\n- C&D - Machine Shop\n- C&D - Student Shop\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back at the initial list, the C&D areas are:\n\nC&D - Coffee Area (x=100,y=100)\n\nC&D - Design Teams (x=25,y=75)\n\nC&D - East Entrance (x=30,y=60)\n\nC&D - Machine Shop (x=10,y=50)\n\nC&D - Student Shop (x=95,y=40)\n\nRoboHub is another waypoint.\n\nSouth Entrance, E5 Entrance, etc., are also present.\n\nSo the user mentioned \"South Entrance.\" Looking at the data, I see there's a South Entrance with x: 0.0, y: 0.0? Wait no\u2014the starting locations say X=0,Y=0, but in the waypoint list, the South Entrance is not directly listed\u2014unless it's one of the named areas.\n\nWait, perhaps \"South Entrance\" refers to an area like C&D - Coffee Area or another specific point. Alternatively, maybe it's a different section altogether.\n\nBut looking at the initial data, the only way points with known names are:\n\nC&D - Coffee Area,\n\nRoboHub,\n\nShower A and B,\n\nE5,\n\nWait, no\u2014the data lists various areas under C&D like Coffee, Design Teams, etc., but \"South Entrance\" isn't explicitly listed. So perhaps that's an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo if I start at the South Entrance (unknown), then go to C&D - Coffee Area (known). But since starting point is unknown, what do we do?\n\nWait, maybe in this context, the user is implying moving from wherever they are currently located to the Coffee Area. So perhaps just navigate directly to it.\n\nBut according to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, output an action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nSo first, checking for South Entrance:\n\nFrom the list of waypoints, I don't see an entry for \"South Entrance.\" Similarly, C&D - Coffee Area is known. So starting at South Entrance (unknown) would require a speak action.\n\nWait no\u2014wait, perhaps the user means to start from their current location and go towards Coffee Area. But according to the instructions, if any waypoint in the prompt is unknown, we have to output an error message about it.\n\nSo since \"South Entrance\" isn't listed as a known waypoint, we should respond accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
