    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the starting point is at (0.0, 0.0). The user wants to go to an E5 Entrance and then locate Microwaves. I need to see if these are known waypoints or if they're unknown.\n\nLooking through the list of available waypoints:\n\n- **E5 Entrance**: Hmm, there's a waypoint called \"E5\" listed as \"Microwave Storage - E5\" with coordinates (800, 436). So, that's definitely a valid waypoint. The user might mean to go directly to this location.\n\nWait, but the prompt says \"E5 Entrance.\" I don't see an \"E5 Entrance\" in the list. There is \"Microwave Storage - E5,\" so maybe they're referring to that as the E5 Entrance for simplicity.\n\nNext, after reaching the E5 Entrance (which is the Microwave Storage), the user wants to find Microwaves. But since the E5 Entrance's waypoint name already includes \"Microwave Storage,\" I think the next step is clear\u2014they just need to navigate there again or perhaps move around within that area to get the microwaves.\n\nSo, first action: Navigate to the E5 Entrance (which is the Microwave Storage). Then, from there, find the Microwaves. But wait, do we have a specific waypoint for theMicrowave location? Looking back at the list:\n\n- I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwave\" or \"Microwaves.\" The closest is \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic,\" which isn't relevant.\n\nTherefore, after reaching the E5 Entrance, since there's no specific waypoint for microwaves, we might have to stay there. But perhaps the user expects a navigate action back to that same location or an action to find it again.\n\nBut based on the initial list, \"Microwave Storage - E5\" is already the destination. So maybe the second part of the prompt is redundant because they're already at the Microwave Storage area when you go there first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants a navigate command back to that same location after some movement or activity within it.\n\nWait, but the prompt says \"find the Microwaves,\" which might imply looking for something specific. However, since we don't have a waypoint called \"Microwave\" in our list, maybe they just want confirmation of being there, so perhaps another navigate action to stay at that location isn't necessary.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, here's how I can structure the response:\n\n1. Navigate to the E5 Entrance (which is Microwave Storage). If it exists.\n2. Since Microwaves are part of the E5 Entrance, maybe no additional action is needed beyond confirming the location.\n\nBut wait, in the list, \"E5\" refers to \"Microwave Storage - E5,\" so perhaps that's considered their destination for both steps. Therefore:\n\nFirst, navigate to Microwave Storage (E5). Then, since they're already there, no further action is necessary unless they need to do something else.\n\nBut looking at the supported edge cases, if a waypoint isn't found, we have to return an error. So in this case, \"E5 Entrance\" isn't directly listed, but \"Microwave Storage - E5\" exists with coordinates (800, 436). Therefore, the user can be navigated to that location.\n\nAfter reaching there, they might need to find something else, but since microwaves are part of this area, maybe no additional action is required beyond navigating there once. Alternatively, if moving around within this area, perhaps a wait or another navigate command could be issued.\n\nBut the prompt doesn't specify any further actions after finding the microwaves; it just says to find them. Since we don't have a specific waypoint for that purpose, maybe no action is needed beyond navigating to E5.\n\nWait, but according to the supported edge cases, if none of the waypoints match, output an error. But since \"E5\" refers to a known waypoint (Microwave Storage), it should be navigable.\n\nSo overall, I think the only necessary step is to navigate to the E5 Entrance/Microwave Storage location.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 800,\n        \"y\": 436\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
