    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says, \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Enterance?\" First, I need to understand what each part means.\n\nI know that waypoints are given with their names and coordinates. So, the starting point is the Microwaves waypoint. But wait, looking through the list of waypoints provided earlier, I don't see a \"Microwaves\" waypoint listed. There's C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - RoboBar, and some others like E5 Enterance, but not Microwaves.\n\nSo, since there's no known waypoint called \"Microwaves,\" it's an unknown waypoint. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown, I should output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input as \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe the user meant another waypoint or made a typo. But since there's no information about Microwaves, I can't assume that. The prompt also mentions guiding back to E5 Enterance, which is listed as a known waypoint with coordinates (probably 0.0 for both X and Y based on starting point). \n\nHowever, since the starting location isn't specified beyond \"Starting at the Microwaves,\" and Microwaves isn't a known waypoint, I have to treat it as unknown. Therefore, regardless of where they are trying to go next, the first step is acknowledging that the starting point doesn't exist.\n\nSo, the action would be to speak with the message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
