    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The command is \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the command step by step. The first part is \"Travel to the E5 Entrance.\" So, that seems straightforward\u2014it's a navigation action from whatever starting point they're at, which in this case is probably their current location. Then, after arriving there, the next instruction is \"find the Microwaves.\"\n\nNow, for each of these steps, I need to check if the waypoints exist based on the provided list.\n\nStarting with \"E5 Entrance.\" Looking through the available waypoints, I don't see a waypoint named E5 or anything that corresponds directly to it. The closest might be \"Shower B\" at (827, 610), but that's not relevant here. So, \"E5 Entrance\" doesn't exist.\n\nSince the first part of the command is asking to travel to a non-existent waypoint, I should return an error message for that action. In the supported edge cases, if a waypoint isn't found, we output a speak action saying it's unknown.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \"find the Microwaves.\" Without knowing exactly where the Microwaves are located, but given the available waypoints, I don't see any specific waypoint mentioned. There's nothing about microwaves in the list provided. So this instruction is also invalid because the destination isn't a known waypoint.\n\nPutting it all together, both parts of the command involve waypoints that don't exist. Therefore, the appropriate response would be to handle each step individually and return an error for any unknown waypoints encountered.\n\nSo first, when trying to navigate to \"E5 Entrance,\" since it's not found, I'll execute a speak action informing the user about the unknown waypoint. Then, moving on to finding the Microwaves, which isn't a known waypoint either, so another speak action is needed with an appropriate message.\n\nI think that covers both parts of the command, leading to two separate speak actions in the response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Sorry, I don't know what 'E5 Entrance' is.
