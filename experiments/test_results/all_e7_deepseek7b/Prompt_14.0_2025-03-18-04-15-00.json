    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Go from north entrance to the Hub.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the starting location is at (0.0, 0.0). The user wants to move from the North Entrance to the Hub. So, my first thought is, do these points exist in our list of waypoints?\n\nLooking through the list, I see a waypoint called \"North Entrance\" with coordinates X: -1254.873926367, Y: 0.0 and another named \"RoboHub.\" Wait, actually, RoboHub isn't listed here; instead, there's something called \"RoboHub Entrance\" at (25, 50). So maybe that's the Hub they're referring to.\n\nNext, I need to see if these points can be navigated in sequence. The starting point is (0,0), and the first destination is (-1254.873926367, 0.0). Then from there to (25, 50). So, the actions would involve navigating to each point one after another.\n\nI should check if both waypoints exist. The North Entrance exists with X: -1254.87 and Y: 0.0, and RoboHub Entrance is at X: 25.0, Y:50. So yes, they do exist.\n\nNow, according to the advanced fuzzy matching rules, I need to normalize both inputs by converting them to lowercase. The user's input is already in lowercase except for spaces, which probably won't affect it much.\n\nTokenization comes next. For the waypoints, \"north entrance\" becomes [\"north\", \"entrance\"], and \"robou_hub\" (after normalization) would be [\"robou_hub\"]. Wait, but actually, the waypoint name after normalization should match exactly. Let me check: RoboHub Entrance is written as such in our list. But when we normalize both user input tokens and waypoints, does that matter?\n\nWait no, I think in this case, since the user's input doesn't have \"robou_hub\", but \"RoboHub Entrance,\" which normalizes to \"robou_hub entrance.\" Hmm, maybe the waypoint names need exact matches after normalization. So if the waypoint name is \"robohub_entrance\" or something else, it might not match.\n\nWait, looking back at our waypoints: RoboHub Entrance is spelled as such in the list with an underscore? Wait no, actually, in the initial list of waypoints, some have underscores and others use spaces. For example, \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So when we tokenize, perhaps we should split on both spaces and underscores.\n\nWait, maybe tokenization isn't just splitting by spaces but also considering other delimiters like periods or hyphens. But according to the problem statement, it's not specified, so I'll assume that tokenization is based solely on spaces after normalization.\n\nSo \"RoboHub Entrance\" becomes [\"robohub_entrance\"] if underscores are considered part of tokens? Or maybe split into [\"robo\", \"hub\", \"entrance\"]. Hmm, the problem says to tokenize both cleaned user input and known waypoints. So perhaps when tokenizing, we need to consider splitting on any non-letter characters or just spaces.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that tokenization is done by splitting on whitespace only. Therefore, \"RoboHub Entrance\" would be [\"robohub_entrance\"], which might not match if the waypoint name has a different structure.\n\nWait, but in our list of waypoints, we have \"RoboHub\" without an entrance mentioned except as \"RoboHub Entrance.\" So maybe the user is referring to that.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. The key points are: the North Entrance exists and RoboHub Entrance also exists. So moving from one to the other should be possible, so the actions would include two navigate steps in sequence.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the prompt \"Go from north entrance to the Hub,\" we need to:\n\n1. **Identify Waypoints**: \n   - The starting point is the North Entrance at (X: -1254.873926367, Y: 0.0).\n   - The destination is RoboHub Entrance at (X: 25, Y: 50).\n\n2. **Check Waypoint Existence**: \n   Both waypoints exist in our list.\n\n3. **Plan Navigation Steps**:\n   - First navigate to the North Entrance.\n   - Then from there, navigate to RoboHub Entrance.\n\nThe resulting actions are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n        \"x\": -1254.873926367,\n        \"y\": 0.0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 25.0,\n        \"y\": 50.0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
