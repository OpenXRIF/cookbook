    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this query from the user: \"Navigate to the first floor staircase.\" My task is to figure out how to respond with an action. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the prompt and see if any waypoints exist in the list provided. The user is asking to navigate to a specific location: the first floor staircase. I should check if this is one of the known waypoints.\n\nLooking at the list, there are several waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"RoboHub Entrance,\" etc., but I don't see an entry for \"first floor staircase.\" So, according to the guidelines, since it's not a known waypoint and doesn't meet the similarity threshold, I need to output actions that say it's invalid.\n\nNext, based on the handling of unknown waypoints section, if no known waypoint meets the criteria, the response should be a single speak action with an error message. The user asked for navigation, so I'll structure the action accordingly but since there's no valid waypoint, it's more about informing them that the location isn't recognized.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the action would involve speaking to inform the user that \"The staircase does not exist.\" Even though they requested a navigate action, without a valid waypoint, the appropriate response is just to speak.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"The first floor staircase does not exist.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
