For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"It's too loud here! Let's go Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out RoboHub.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user says, \"It's too loud here! Let's go Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out RoboHub.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key actions and waypoints mentioned. They mention two main places: Silent Study and RoboHub. So, my initial thought is that they want me to navigate to Silent Study first because it's an action they're taking after something else.\n\nNow, looking at the supported functions, which are \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" and \"wait.\" The user isn't using any of these more complex commands, so I don't need to worry about handling ambiguous or unsupported actions beyond the basics.\n\nNext, the user says, \"It's too loud here!\" But since the main instruction is about moving from one place to another, maybe they just want me to go to Silent Study. They might not be asking for a specific action like speaking or waiting unless it's part of navigating to that spot.\n\nSo, my first action should be to navigate to Silent Study. I need to find the coordinates for that waypoint. From the data provided earlier, Silent Study is at E5 Entrance with X=1535 and Y=1535. \n\nI don't see any mention of speaking or waiting here; it seems like a straightforward navigation command. So, the action list should just have one step: navigating to Silent Study.\n\nWait, but in another example given, when moving between two places with stops, they included multiple navigate actions with intermediate points. However, in this case, the user didn't specify where exactly to go after Silent Study except \"RoboHub.\" But RoboHub isn't listed among the waypoints provided earlier\u2014there's no mention of it.\n\nThis might be an oversight since RoboHub wasn't part of the initial data set. But according to the example responses, if a waypoint is unknown, I should return a speak action saying that it doesn't exist. Since \"RoboHub\" isn't listed, after going to Silent Study, when trying to go to RoboHub, it would be considered unknown.\n\nBut in this specific prompt, maybe they only want to navigate to Silent Study and then presumably proceed from there without needing to specify another destination beyond that. Alternatively, if the user intended to also go to RoboHub but it's not listed, I might have to adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, looking back at the waypoints list provided earlier, I don't see a RoboHub mentioned. The only waypoint with \"Robo\" is E5 Entrance for Silent Study. Therefore, when moving from Silent Study to RoboHub, since RoboHub isn't in our data set, it's considered unknown.\n\nBut given the user's instruction says \"then afterwards, we can check out RoboHub,\" maybe they are implying that after Silent Study, I should navigate to RoboHub if possible. Since RoboHub isn't a known waypoint, this would result in a speak action informing them that RoboHub doesn't exist.\n\nHowever, since the primary instruction is about going to Silent Study first, perhaps the main action is just navigating there, and checking out RoboHub might be an additional note but not part of the immediate actions. But according to the problem statement, all instructions should be translated into actions based on waypoints known or unknowns.\n\nBut given that the user says \"Please go [action] then check out,\" it's possible they want both steps: first navigate to Silent Study and then attempt to navigate to RoboHub. Since RoboHub is unknown, the second step would result in a speak action with an error message about it not existing.\n\nHowever, perhaps the user only wants to navigate to Silent Study because that's their main request. The \"RoboHub\" part might be extraneous unless explicitly required by the user.\n\nBut according to the example provided earlier, when handling complex commands, we process them in a left-to-right sequence unless told otherwise. So, I should first handle going to Silent Study and then check out RoboHub if possible.\n\nSince RoboHub isn't available, it's an unknown waypoint. Therefore, after navigating to Silent Study, the next action would be trying to navigate to RoboHub, which is not found, resulting in a speak action.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The primary instruction seems to be just going to Silent Study because that's the only specific waypoint mentioned beyond what was given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"It's too loud here!\" refers to being in the current location, so moving to Silent Study is their main action, and then they want to check RoboHub afterwards, which isn't a known destination.\n\nBut regardless, since the user mentions both actions: going to Silent Study and then checking RoboHub. Given that, I need to structure the actions accordingly. First navigate to Silent Study, then try to go to RoboHub. If RoboHub is unknown, output an action where navigating fails with a speak message.\n\nBut according to the initial data set, only Silent Study is present as E5 Entrance at (1535, 1535). So, the first action is to navigate there. Then attempting to go to RoboHub, which isn't known, so outputting a speak action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nHowever, since \"check out\" might imply an action or observation rather than navigation, maybe after moving to Silent Study, I need to perform some action like speaking. But the user didn't specify anything else beyond navigation and checking.\n\nThis is getting tricky because without explicit instructions for speech actions, but given that in examples a navigate command was translated into a single action with coordinates, perhaps the only necessary step here is navigating to Silent Study.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's request effectively:\n\n1. **Navigate to Silent Study**: This involves moving to the E5 Entrance at coordinates (1535, 1535). Since Silent Study is listed among the waypoints, this action is feasible.\n\n2. **Attempt to Check Out RoboHub**: After reaching Silent Study, the next step would be navigating to RoboHub. However, upon reviewing the provided data set, there's no entry for RoboHub. This makes it an unknown waypoint.\n\nGiven that only the first part of the request (navigating to Silent Study) can be executed with available information, here's how we translate this into actions:\n\n**Action List:**\n- Navigate to E5 Entrance at coordinates (1535, 1535).\n\nThis action handles the main instruction provided by the user. The subsequent attempt to navigate to RoboHub would require additional data not present in the current dataset.",
