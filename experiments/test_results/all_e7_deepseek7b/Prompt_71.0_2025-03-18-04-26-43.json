    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the user is asking for with their prompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the starting location, it's at X:827.0 and Y:610.0. Checking the available waypoints around that area... Hmm, I see a waypoint called Shower B located exactly at 827, 610. That seems perfect because the user is asking about taking a shower.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other nearby showers? Let me check all the waypoints. Shower A is at 359,475 and B at 827,610, and another at 447,500. Since the starting point is right where Shower B is, it's definitely the closest one.\n\nNow, according to the functions available\u2014navigate, speak, and wait\u2014it makes sense for the user to navigate directly to Shower B. There's no need to do anything else like speaking or waiting because they just want to take a shower there.\n\nSo the action should be straightforward: navigate to Shower B at 827,610.\n</think>\n\nThe user is requesting to go for a shower, and based on their location, the closest available shower is at Shower B (X:827.0, Y:610.0). \n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
