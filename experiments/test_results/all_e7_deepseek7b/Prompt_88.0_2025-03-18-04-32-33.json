    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is telling the robot to proceed to the Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to parse this command. It seems like it's in a different format than the examples given, but maybe the structure is similar.\n\nLooking at the supported edge cases, if the waypoint isn't found, we return an action with \"speak\" saying it doesn't exist. But wait, the user didn't mention an unknown waypoint directly; they mentioned \"Silent Study.\" I need to check if that's a valid waypoint.\n\nFrom the waypoint list provided, I don't see any entry for Silent Study. There are entries like Ideas Clinic and RoboHub, but nothing called Silent Study. So, according to the edge cases, this is an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo, following the instructions, when an unknown waypoint is encountered, we return a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" Even though the user included a wait command, since the main issue is the unknown waypoint, that's what needs to be addressed first. The waiting part might need to be handled separately or maybe it's part of another step.\n\nWait, actually, in the examples given, after finding the waypoint, they include other actions like navigate and speak. But if the waypoints are missing, the robot should just handle the unknown part and ignore the rest for now.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the action is to speak that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
