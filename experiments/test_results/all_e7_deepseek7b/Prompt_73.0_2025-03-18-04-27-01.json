    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the user wants based on their prompt. They said, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the starting location is at (874.0, 613.0). The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So I need to see if there's a known waypoint that matches what they're asking for.\n\nLooking through the waypoints list, I don't see any named \"Shower\" or anything related like \"Shower B\". Wait, there is a Shower B at (827, 610). Maybe that's close enough? Or perhaps they just meant to go for a shower in general without specifying which one.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I have to match waypoints using fuzzy matching. The user input is \"I could really go for a shower.\" So let me normalize this: lowercase and remove any extraneous tokens. The normalized form would be something like \"i could really go for a shower.\"\n\nNow, checking each waypoint name against this. The Shower B has the word \"Shower\" in it, but looking at the tokenization step, I need to ensure that all tokens from the waypoint are present in the user's input.\n\nShower B is just one word: \"Shower\". The user's cleaned input includes \"shower\", so technically, it matches. But if there are more tokens like \"B\" or something else, but since they're only looking for a shower, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, is there another waypoint closer to the starting location? The starting point is (874, 613), and Shower B is at (827, 610). That's pretty close. So maybe I can navigate to Shower B.\n\nAlternatively, if there are no other matching waypoints, then it would fall back to \"speak\" action with the message that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo considering all that, the best course of action is to navigate to Shower B.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
