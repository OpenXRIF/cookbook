For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay\"\n",

    "Experiment ID": 12.0,
    "Prompt ID": 81.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user says, \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay.\" Hmm, first, I need to parse this command.\n\nSo, breaking it down: they want me to go to the C&D area, ask for a coffee, and then move to the Design Team Bay. But wait, looking at the available waypoints, there's no \"c&d\" in lowercase; it's spelled as \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So I guess that should be normalized.\n\nFirst step is normalization. The user's input is \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay.\" Converting everything to lowercase gives \"go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay.\"\n\nNext, extraneous tokens removal. Removing any building codes or non-essential parts. So we can remove \"c&d\" because \"&\" is likely an operator, but maybe it's part of the name? Wait, no, in normalization, both input and waypoints are converted to lowercase, so perhaps \"C&D - Coffee Area\" becomes \"c&d coffee area.\" Hmm, I'm not sure if that makes sense. Maybe during tokenization, it would split into [\"c\", \"&\", \"d\", \"coffee\", \"area\"], but since the known waypoint is \"c&d coffee area,\" maybe it's better to ignore non-letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"C&D - Coffee Area\" should be normalized as \"cand d coffee area,\" which doesn't make sense. Wait, that might not work. Maybe we should remove tokens that start with letters but contain numbers or symbols at the beginning. So in this case, \"c&d\" would have a token \"c&d,\" which is alphanumeric and non-letters, so maybe it's kept.\n\nBut looking at the supported waypoints, there's no \"c&d coffee area.\" The closest is \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So perhaps during normalization, we split into [\"Go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"c&d\", \"and\", \"ask\", \"for\", \"a\", \"coffee\", \"then\", \"go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"design\", \"team\", \"bay\"].\n\nNow, for each known waypoint, like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" tokenize it into [\"c&d\", \"coffee\", \"area\"]. Now, checking if all tokens from the waypoint are in the user's input. The user has \"c&d\" and \"coffee,\" but not \"area.\" So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe during extraneous token removal, we remove any parts starting with a number or non-letter. In this case, \"c&d\" starts with letters, so it's kept.\n\nSo the known waypoints are:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area: tokens [\"c&d\", \"coffee\", \"area\"]\n- RoboHub: [\"robohub\"]\n- E5 Entrance: [\"e5\", \"engineering\", \"design teams\", \"machine shop\", \"student shop\"]\n- etc.\n\nLooking at the user's input, after normalization and tokenization:\n\n[\"go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"c&d\", \"and\", \"ask\", \"for\", \"a\", \"coffee\", \"then\", \"go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"design\", \"team\", \"bay\"]\n\nWe need to check if any known waypoint's tokens are a subset of the user's input tokens. The first part is asking to go to C&D and ask for coffee, which includes \"c&d\" and \"coffee.\" So perhaps we can find a waypoint that has these as required.\n\nLooking through the waypoints:\n\n- \"C&D - Coffee Area\": requires [\"c&d\", \"coffee\", \"area\"]. But user's input doesn't have \"area,\" so no match.\n- \"RoboHub\": just \"robohub\"; not relevant here since they're going to C&D first.\n- \"Design Team Bay\" or similar? Wait, looking at the list: there's \"Student Shop (Building 6)\" but nothing called Design Team Bay. There's a \"Design Teams - Machine Shop\" waypoint with tokens [\"design\", \"teams\", \"machine\", \"shop\"]. But in the user's input, they go to \"the design team bay,\" which would be similar.\n\nWait, the waypoints include \"Student Shop (Building 6)\" but not Design Team Bay. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after asking for coffee at C&D, the next part is to go to Design Team Bay, which might correspond to a waypoint named something like \"Design Teams - Machine Shop.\" So checking that:\n\n\"Design teams\", \"machine\", \"shop\" are tokens from the waypoint. The user's input has \"design\", \"team\", \"bay,\" but in the known waypoints, I don't see an exact match.\n\nWait, maybe there's a waypoint called \"Student Shop (Building 6)\" which is [\"student\", \"shop\", \"(building 6)\"]. That doesn't match \"Design Team Bay.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and then to \"Student Shop.\" But the user mentions Design Team Bay. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe during extraneous token removal, \"the design team bay\" becomes tokens like [\"design\", \"team\", \"bay\"], which is a different set than any known waypoint's tokens except maybe none.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a waypoint that includes \"Design Teams - Machine Shop,\" but in the given list, it's called \"Design Team Bay.\" Wait, no, looking back at the provided waypoints:\n\n- E5 Entrance: [\"e5\", ...]\n- Student Shop (Building 6): [\"student shop\"]\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check the original list again.\n\nOh wait, in the initial list, under other roles, there's \"Student Shop (Building 6)\" but nothing about Design Team Bay. So maybe the user made a mistake or it's not present.\n\nBut going back to the command: after asking for coffee at C&D, they need to go to Design Team Bay. Since that waypoint might not be available, perhaps the best is to go to Student Shop instead. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Design Team Bay\" corresponds to a waypoint with tokens like [\"design\", \"team\", \"bay\"], but in the known list, there's none. So perhaps it's better to go with the closest match or assume no such waypoint exists and respond accordingly.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made an error earlier. Let me double-check the waypoints:\n\nFrom the initial data provided, under roles, there is \"Student Shop (Building 6)\" but nothing else related to Design Team Bay. So perhaps the user's second part doesn't have a matching waypoint.\n\nSo in that case, the best response would be to go to C&D - Coffee Area and ask for coffee, then proceed to Student Shop if Design Team Bay isn't available. Alternatively, maybe there's another waypoint I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe \"C&D\" refers to something else? No, it's spelled as \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So perhaps the user intended to go to that area, get coffee, and then move on, but without a Design Team Bay waypoint, maybe they can just note that the second part is not available.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that after the C&D part, if there's no matching Design Team Bay waypoint, perhaps we have to respond accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo execute your request, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Normalization**: Convert all text to lowercase and remove any non-letter tokens.
