    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to handle this prompt. The user says, \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse what they're asking for. It seems like a navigation command where they want to go from their current location (0,0) to a specific waypoint named \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nI'll start by looking up if \"E7 silent study\" exists in the list of waypoints provided. Let's check the available waypoints:\n\n- There are several areas mentioned: C&D Coffee Area, Ideas Clinic, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but I don't see an entry for E7 silent study. The user might have meant something else or it could be a typo.\n\nAssuming \"E7 silent study\" isn't listed, the next step is to consider if any other waypoint matches this name after normalization and tokenization. For example, maybe someone named E7 Study or similar exists elsewhere in the list? Looking through, I don't see that either. \n\nSince there's no known waypoint matching \"E7 silent study,\" according to the guidelines, we should output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input stating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to make sure that all possible interpretations are considered. Maybe they meant a different waypoint or there's a mistake in the name. But based on what's provided, it seems safe to proceed with the fallback response.\n\nSo, the final action will be a speak command informing them that the requested waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: E7 silent study\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
