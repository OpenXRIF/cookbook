Words associated with the waypoint, B-01-111 are Battery, M12, Milwaukee.\n\nThe robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0\n\nEach waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., \"B-86-109\") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"What is the part number for an M8 washer?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the part number is for an M8 washer. Let me see... The user provided several examples where they had specific requests and their corresponding actions. Looking back, in one of those examples, when someone asked for a specific washer, they identified it as section A-01-001, which had a part number M8 locknuts. \n\nNow, the query is about an M8 washer. I need to think about where washers are typically stored or located. From my knowledge, most parts are in specific containers based on their type and size. Since it's an M8 washer, maybe they're part of a set that goes by a certain code.\n\nWait, let me recall if I've seen something similar before. There was a request where the user mentioned \"could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?\" which led to selecting A1-05 and waiting 5 seconds. But for washers, maybe it's a different container. I think M8 washers are probably stored under a specific section.\n\nLooking back at the examples provided, when someone asked about a washer or lock nut, they identified them as specific codes in sections. So perhaps for an M8 washer, it would be something like A-01-001 again? But that might not make sense because I remember reading somewhere that M8 is usually under another section.\n\nWait, maybe the section is different. Let me think... Maybe it's C-06 or A-05? Or perhaps a different code entirely. Alternatively, the user might have asked about something else and then this comes up, so they need to be careful not to repeat the same mistake.\n\nI should check if I can find any related information elsewhere. Oh, actually, there was a response where someone asked for an M6 locknut, which they found in section A1-05 as A1-05-113. So perhaps following that logic, M8 would be in another code like C-06-161 or something else.\n\nWait, but I think washers are more commonly stored under different sections than parts with specific holes. Maybe it's a specific section where they handle industrial bolts or such. Let me recall the example where the user asked about the Milwaukee Power Drill and got B-04-075 as part of their request. So if M8 is another type, perhaps in A-01-002?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should just list possible options. Alternatively, since the user provided an example for M6, which was found in A1-05-113, following that structure, maybe M8 would be C-06-161 or A-05-114? But without specific knowledge, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the types of parts. Wridon washers might be part of a different code. Alternatively, industrial bolts are often in section B-... I'm not certain. Maybe C-06 or A-05?\n\nBut since I don't have exact information, maybe the safest way is to respond that the M8 washer's code isn't provided and needs more context. But wait, looking back at the initial instructions, they do mention handling complex commands step by step.\n\nSo perhaps I should check if there are any similar requests and see what their actions were. The user had a request about a washer leading them to A01-001, which was M8 locknuts. Maybe for a washer, it's in another section.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the washer is part of a set that goes with a specific code, like B-04 or something else. But since I can't be certain, I should probably respond that without further information, the exact code isn't provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"The part number for an M8 washer is not specified in the provided context.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
