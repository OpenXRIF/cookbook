Words associated with the waypoint, B-01-111 are Battery, M12, Milwaukee.\n\nThe robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0\n\nEach waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., \"B-86-109\") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"Do we really need bolts? Can you get me an impact?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's question. They asked if we really need bolts and if they can get an \"impact.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst off, the user is asking about getting something called \" Impact,\" but it's not one of the supported commands like navigate or speak. I remember from earlier examples that when there are no clear references to waypoints or actions, certain error messages come up. So maybe this should trigger an action where they get a specific message.\n\nLooking at the guidelines, if none of the supported actions match the request, we have to output something with an error message. But wait, is \"Impact\" one of those supported actions? No, I think only navigate, speak, or wait are allowed. So this should be classified as an unsupported action, which makes sense.\n\nBut then again, there's that complex command section where if the command isn't within the supported ones, it returns a specific error. But in this case, the user is using \"Impact,\" which isn't even a command they're trying to execute yet. So maybe I'm overcomplicating things. \n\nI think the key here is recognizing that the question is about getting an impact without any prior action. So perhaps the response should be a general instruction, like \"Please get me something to make our trip fun.\" That way, it's clear and doesn't rely on previous actions.\n\nWait, but what if they don't know what an Impact is? Maybe I should mention that they need to define their terms or clarify what they mean by \"impact.\" But the user didn't ask for clarification. They just asked a question in general. So perhaps it's acceptable to respond with the instruction as above.\n\nPutting it all together, I should acknowledge the query and inform them of how to proceed without prior actions, giving them a clear direction to take next.\n</think>\n\nThe response should address the user's request by providing a clear instruction or action that would be appropriate based on their question. Since \"Impact\" isn't a supported command or function, it needs to trigger an error message indicating that it's unsupported and how they should proceed instead.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Context:** The user is asking if they need bolts and if they can get them. However, their query uses unclear terms like \"Impact,\" which isn't a supported function or action in the system.\n\n2. **Identify the Issue:** Since \"Impact\" isn't a recognized command within the supported functions (navigate, speak, wait), it's classified as an unsupported request.\n\n3. **Generate an Error Response:** The system should recognize that no further actions can be taken and inform the user with a clear error message about the unsupported function.\n\n4. **Provide Clear Instructions:** The response should instruct the user on how to proceed, likely by asking them to define their terms or ask for more information before proceeding.\n\n**Final Response:**\n\nIt seems there's an error here. Please clarify what you mean by \"Impact\" and provide specific instructions.",
