The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Experiment ID": 7.0,
    "Prompt ID": 50.0,
    "Prompt": "\"I need some windsheild washer fluid.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to help the user who said they need some windsheet washer fluid. Let me start by understanding what the term \"windsheet\" refers to here. It could be a typo for \"windsor,\" which is a brand known for its cleaning products like laundry detergents. Alternatively, it might just mean something different, but since it's related to washing products, I'll go with \"windsor.\"\n\nThe user wants windsheet washer fluid, so I need to identify where this product is located in the supply chain or storage areas. Looking at the provided examples and instructions, there are several steps involved: navigating to the correct container, picking up the item, and then waiting for it.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned they want some \"windsheild washer fluid.\" Wait, that's not right\u2014it should be \"windsor.\" But assuming it's typo-free, I'll proceed. So, windsheet is probably a brand with a specific product line, likely under a category like detergents or cleaners.\n\nIn the example responses given earlier, when someone asks for a specific item from a container code, they navigate to that name, pick up the item, and wait. But there are cases where actions need to be taken beyond just picking up an item\u2014like if it's not found, you have to speak. Also, in complex commands with multiple steps, each action must be executed in order.\n\nSo, breaking down the user's request: they want windsheet washer fluid. I need to identify which container holds this product. The process would involve:\n\n1. Navigating to the correct container named \"Windsheild\" or whatever it's actually called.\n2. Picking up the specific item from that container.\n3. Wait, maybe for a certain amount of time.\n\nLooking at the examples again, when they said \"it's in section C,\" I think the sections are labeled with specific names, so I'll look for something like \"Section A-01-001\" or another similar name that contains windsheet washer fluid.\n\nBut since I don't have access to the specific details of each storehouse and the items they contain, I should rely on common practices. Typically, such products are stored in separate locations from their main detergents or chemicals. So, after navigating to the right container, picking up the item, and waiting for it.\n\nIn the example where the user asked for M6-1.0x55mm bolts, they couldn't find it because the code was invalid. So, if I were to respond, I would need to check if \"Windsheild\" has a product line that includes such specifications. If not, then output an error saying the request is invalid.\n\nBut since the user specifically asked for washer fluid, which I don't have exact information on, I might assume that it's a common item and present a command accordingly, but maybe they can be found in another section or under different names.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the initial query, the user said \"windsheet fluid.\" Maybe that's a typo for \"windsor,\" which is more commonly associated with detergents. So, I should proceed accordingly.\n\nIn any case, based on the structured response provided earlier, I would structure my answer to navigate to the correct container code, pick up the item, and wait. But in this specific case, since I can't access the exact names or locations, I might need to explain that without further information it's challenging to provide an accurate action list.\n\nBut perhaps, given that windsheet is a detergent brand, it might be under another name. Let me think\u2014if I were to respond, I would first try to navigate via commands like \"navigate\" to the container with the correct code, then pick up the item and wait. However, without specific details, I can't execute this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is looking for a different product, but since they specifically said washer fluid, I have to work with that. So, perhaps I should inform them that I need more information about the exact container code or location to provide an accurate and effective response.\n</think>\n\nThe user has not provided specific details about their request, such as the exact container code or location of windsheet washer fluid. As a result, we cannot accurately respond with a structured command sequence. Please confirm the correct container name or verify the product line containing windsheet washer fluid to proceed effectively.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Navigate to the Correct Container:** \n   - The user needs to navigate to the specific container holding windsheet washer fluid.\n   - This would involve using a command like `navigate` with the exact name of the container, such as \"Windsheild\" or another appropriate term.\n\n2. **Pick Up the Item:**\n   - Once at the container, pick up the designated washer fluid item by following up with a command.\n\n3. **Wait for Delivery:**\n   - After retrieving the product, wait for it to be delivered.\n\nWithout specific information on where windsheet washer fluid is located or its exact name, we cannot provide an accurate and effective response. Please confirm the container code or location associated with windsheet washer fluid for a detailed and precise assistance.",
