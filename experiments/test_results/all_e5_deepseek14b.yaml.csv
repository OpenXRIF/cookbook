# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. The user said, ""Robot, go to Silent Study and say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should check if ""Silent Study"" is one of the available waypoints provided. Looking back at the waypoint list, I see options like ""E7 ideas clinic"", ""C&D - Coffee Area"", ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic"", and others, but there's no mention of ""Silent Study"". So, it seems like this isn't a valid waypoint.

Next, according to the rules provided, if the cleaned input doesn't match any keywords or the waypoint name, I should output an error message. The user tried to include an action after navigating, which would be speaking, but since the waypoint is invalid, I can't process that part.

I also need to ensure I only use supported actions: navigate, speak, and wait. Since ""Silent Study"" isn't a valid waypoint, I don't generate any navigation or speak actions. Instead, I should return an error response indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.

So, my final response will be to speak that the waypoint doesn't exist, without any other actions.
</think>

The user has requested to navigate to ""Silent Study"" and then say ""Silent Study"" in a calm voice. However, upon reviewing the available waypoints, none match the criteria for ""Silent Study"". Therefore, the request is invalid.

```json

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's question. The user asked, ""Do you know where the welding room is?"" Let me break down what needs to be done here.

First, I need to understand the problem step by step. The user is asking for information about a specific location, which in this case is the welding room. My task is to determine if this welding room exists as a waypoint based on the provided data and then respond accordingly.

Looking at the waypoints listed, I don't see any entry named ""welding room"" or anything similar. The available waypoints include places like ""E7 - Ideas Clinic,"" ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" ""RoboHub Entrance,"" and others, but none related to welding. 

Next, according to the rules provided, I have to check if any of the keywords associated with the waypoints match the user's query after ignoring any extra tokens. The user's input is straightforward: they're asking about the welding room. So, I would look through each waypoint's keywords to see if ""welding"" or related terms are present.

Going through each waypoint:

- E7 - Ideas Clinic: Keywords include ""ideas,"" ""clinic."" No match.
- C&D - Coffee Area: Keywords like ""coffee."" Not relevant.
- RoboHub Entrance: Keywords about the hub, not welding.
- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic: Same as E7.
- Makerspace Lab: This one has keywords like ""makers,"" ""lab,"" ""workshop."" Hmm, maybe? But the user specifically mentioned welding, which is a specific skill. The makerspace might have welding equipment, but it's not explicitly listed as such in the waypoints provided.

Wait, in the initial data, I don't see a waypoint named ""Makerspace Lab"" with welding-related keywords. Let me check again. No, looking back, the Makerspace Lab has keywords like ""makers,"" ""lab,"" ""workshop."" There's no explicit mention of welding or any related terms.

Since the user is asking about the welding room and none of the waypoints explicitly include that term or have relevant keywords, I can't find a matching waypoint. The rules state that if the cleaned input doesn't contain any of the defined keywords for any available waypoint, it should be considered invalid.

Therefore, my response should inform the user that the waypoint does not exist. According to the instructions, I need to output a speak action with the message ""This waypoint does not exist.""

I don't see any other actions required here because the user isn't asking to navigate or perform any tasks beyond asking for information. So, the only action needed is to speak the error message.

In summary, since there's no welding room listed as a waypoint and none of the existing waypoints have related keywords that match, I'll respond by telling the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request: ""Take me to the Formula Electric Electric Bay."" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the available waypoints and their keywords. The user is asking for the ""Formula Electric Electric Bay,"" which seems a bit off with two ""Electric"" words. Maybe it's a typo or they meant something specific.

Looking through the waypoints provided, there are entries like ""Formula Electric"" with keywords including ""formula electric."" But I don't see any waypoint named ""Electric Bay"" or anything similar. The closest is ""Concrete Canoe"" and others under section 1004, but that's not related to Formula Electric.

Wait, maybe the user intended to refer to the Formula Electric waypoint but added an extra word by mistake. So when they say ""Formula Electric Electric Bay,"" I should check if any keywords match with ""formula electric."" The Formula Electric waypoint has keywords like ""formula"" and ""electric,"" so parts of their request do align.

However, the full name as given doesn't exactly match any existing waypoint. They might have meant to just go to Formula Electric but added an extra word. Since the exact match isn't found and there's ambiguity with the extra words, I can't confidently identify a single waypoint.

I should also consider if ""Electric Bay"" refers to another location not listed in the waypoints. But since it's not present, it's safer to respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

So, putting it all together, the response should inform the user that their requested waypoint isn't found.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Okay, let's break down the user's command. They want me to navigate through several waypoints in a specific order: Formula Electric Mech Bay, then Baja, followed by Rocketry, and finally Midnight Sun.

First, I need to identify each waypoint based on the keywords provided. Starting with ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" From the list, I see that the Mech Bay is associated with keywords like [""formula"", ""electric"", ""mechanical"", etc.]. The cleaned input after removing any extra tokens would be ""formula electric mech bay."" Looking at the waypoints, ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" has keywords including ""formula,"" so this should match.

Next, ""Baja"" is straightforward. The waypoint Baja has keywords like ["" baja""], so it's a direct match.

Then comes ""Rocketry."" Checking the waypoints, there's no entry for Rocketry. So when I process this command, I realize that Rocketry isn't an available waypoint. This means the entire command can't be executed as intended because one of the steps is invalid.

Since Rocketry doesn't exist, I need to respond with an error message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the rules, if any part of the command refers to a non-existent waypoint, the whole action should fail, and I should output the error response.

Therefore, the actions array will contain a single speak action informing the user that ""Rocketry"" is not a valid waypoint.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,"['UWFE - Electrical Bay', 'UWFE - Mech Bay', 'Baja', 'Rocketry', 'Midnight Sun']",Nav,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down what the user is asking for. The query is ""Go to the Concrete canoe team."" I need to figure out if this matches any of the predefined waypoints based on the keywords.

First, I'll process the input by ignoring any extra tokens. In this case, there are no prefixes or other codes, so the cleaned input is just ""Concrete canoe team.""

Next, I'll look through each waypoint's name and keywords to see if there's a match. The Concrete Canoe waypoint has the name ""Concrete Canoe"" with associated keywords like [""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", ""Design Team""]. 

Looking at the user's query, ""Concrete"" is in both the waypoint's name and keywords. Additionally, ""canoe team"" aligns with ""Canoe,"" which is part of the keywords for that waypoint. The mention of ""team"" might not be a keyword, but since the waypoint's name includes ""Concrete Canoe,"" it should still match.

I need to ensure that only one waypoint matches. Since ""Concrete Canoe"" is unique in its keywords and name, there's no ambiguity here.

Therefore, I can confidently determine that the user wants to navigate to the Concrete Canoe waypoint.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's question. The user says, ""I like electric skateboards, what design team should I join?"" Hmm, they're asking about joining a design team related to electric skateboards, which falls under some sort of engineering or tech group.

Looking at the available waypoints provided, I see entries like ""Design Team"" with keywords including ""design"", ""team"", and others. Also, there's a ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Concrete Skis"" teams, but those are about concrete structures, not skateboards. Wait, but none of the listed waypoints seem to directly relate to electric skateboards.

The user is asking for a design team recommendation, so they might be looking for something like an engineering or innovation group on campus. However, based on the given data, the only team that comes close is ""Design Team"" with keywords like [""design"", ""team""]. Even though it's not specific to skateboards, it's the closest match we have.

But wait, the user mentioned electric skateboards, which might imply they're interested in a more tech-oriented or mechanical engineering team. The available waypoints don't specify any such group, but ""Design Team"" is the most relevant. So maybe I should suggest that they join the Design Team as it's related to design and innovation.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is looking for a specific club not listed here, but since we only have these options, we have to go with what's available. It's possible that ""Design Team"" might encompass various projects, including electric skateboards if that's something they take on.

I should make sure that after cleaning the input by ignoring any extra tokens, the keywords match exactly. The user's query doesn't start with any alphanumeric codes, so I can directly process it. The key words here are ""design team,"" which perfectly matches one of the waypoints' name and keywords. So yes, that's the correct match.

Therefore, the response should guide them to join the Design Team because it's the only available option that relates to design and teams, even if it's not specifically about skateboards.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's command. The robot has been given a task: ""Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the available waypoints provided. There are several listed, but the key one here is the North Entrance. Checking the details, North Entrance has coordinates (x=269.0, y=135.0). Its keywords include ""North"" and ""Entrance"". 

The user's command is straightforward: navigate to North Entrance and then speak its name out loud. So I need to generate two actions: one for navigation and another for speaking.

I'll start by creating a 'navigate' action with the correct waypoint name and coordinates. Then, add a 'speak' action where the robot says ""North Entrance"". 

I should ensure that there are no extra tokens in the command, which isn't an issue here since ""North Entrance"" directly matches the waypoint's name and keywords.

So the actions array will have two entries: first navigate to North Entrance, then speak its name. That should fulfill the user's request without any issues.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request. The user asked, ""Can you take me to a car design team?"" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should parse the query according to the rules provided. The main goal is to determine which waypoint the user is referring to, if any. 

The starting location is (0,0), but that's probably not relevant here since we're just navigating to another point.

Looking at the waypoints listed, each has a name and associated keywords. For example, ""Concrete Canoe"" has keywords like ""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", and ""Design Team"". Similarly, ""RoboHub Entrance"" has its own set of keywords.

The user's request is about finding a car design team. I need to see if any waypoint includes the keyword ""car"" or something related. Scanning through the waypoints, I don't see any that mention cars or automotive design. The closest might be ""Concrete Canoe"" with the keyword ""Design Team"", but that's for concrete canoes, not cars.

Wait, there is a waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe"" in section 1004 with keywords including ""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", and ""Design Team"". So if someone mentions ""design team"", this could match. But the user specifically mentioned ""car design team"". Since none of the waypoints have ""car"" or ""automotive"" as a keyword, I can't find a matching waypoint.

I also need to remember the rules about ignoring extra tokens. If the user had something like ""E7 car design team"", I should ignore the ""E7"" part and check if ""car design team"" matches any keywords. But in this case, even after removing any extra tokens, ""car design team"" doesn't match any waypoint's keywords or names.

Therefore, since there's no matching waypoint for ""car design team"", the system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

Okay, so the user says, ""I love Elon Musk and tunnels, what design team should I join?"" Hmm, let me figure this out. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They seem interested in joining a design team related to Elon Musk's work with tunnels, which makes me think of companies like Tesla or The Boring Company.

Looking at the provided waypoints, there are two entries under ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Concrete Canoe - Design Team."" Both have keywords including ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team."" So when the user mentions ""tunnels"" and ""design team,"" these keywords should match the Concrete Canoe design team waypoint.

I need to check if there are any other waypoints that might also fit. Scanning through, I don't see any others with ""design team"" or tunnel-related terms. Therefore, it's clear that the user is referring to the Concrete Canoe - Design Team waypoint.

So, my response should guide them to join this specific design team, providing the relevant information and navigating there if needed. But since the command was just a question, the assistant would respond with the appropriate suggestion.
</think>

To address your question about joining a design team related to Elon Musk's work with tunnels, you might want to consider teams working on innovative engineering projects, particularly in areas like tunnel boring technology or sustainable infrastructure.

Given your interest in ""tunnels"" and being part of a **design team**, I recommend looking into the **Concrete Canoe - Design Team**. This team focuses on designing and building lightweight, high-strength concrete canoes, which is an excellent way to apply engineering principles while working collaboratively on creative projects.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's figure out how to handle this user query. The user asked, ""Do you know where the machine shop is?"" 

First, I need to identify if any of the available waypoints match the keywords related to a machine shop. Looking through the list, none of the waypoints have ""machine"" or ""shop"" as part of their name or keywords. The closest might be ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords like ""concrete"" and ""canoe,"" but that's not relevant here.

Since there's no matching waypoint, I should respond by telling the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the rules, I need to output a speak action with an error message.

I also check if there are any other possible interpretations, but since ""machine shop"" isn't listed anywhere, it's clear that it's invalid. 

So, the response will be a single speak action informing the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's query. The user said, ""Go to the concrete tobbagan team."" Hmm, first step is to parse what they're asking for.

Looking at the rules provided, I know that when interpreting requests, any extra tokens before the main command can be ignored. So in this case, ""concrete"" could be part of the waypoint name, but ""tobagan"" doesn't ring a bell from the waypoints listed.

I need to check each waypoint's keywords and names. The user mentioned ""concrete,"" so I'll look for waypoints with that term. There's one called ""Concrete Team"" with keywords like [""concrete"", ""team""]. But wait, the user wrote ""tobagan"" which doesn't match any of the keywords or the waypoint name.

So after ignoring extra tokens (if any), the cleaned input is ""go to concrete tobbagan team."" The relevant part here is ""concrete,"" but since ""tobagan"" isn't a keyword for that waypoint, it's not a valid match. Also, there might be another issue with the word ""tobagan""—is that a typo? Maybe they meant ""toboggan"" or something else, but I don't see any matching waypoints.

Since none of the keywords from the provided waypoints are present in the cleaned input after ignoring extra tokens, this doesn't point to a valid waypoint. Therefore, according to the rules, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I have this user who wants to go to the restroom. Let's break down how I should handle this request.

First, I need to look at all the available waypoints provided and check if any of them match the keywords related to restrooms or similar terms. Scanning through the list, I see waypoints like ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Concrete Canoe (2)"", but nothing that mentions a restroom, bathroom, or lavatory.

The user's command is straightforward: ""Take me to the restroom."" According to the guidelines, I need to ignore any extra tokens, which in this case isn't an issue since there are no prefixes. Next, I check each waypoint's keywords. None of them include terms like 'restroom', 'bathroom', or 'toilet'.

Since none of the waypoints have relevant keywords, the system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. Therefore, the correct response is to output a speak action indicating that the restroom isn't a valid waypoint.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I've got this user query: ""I need a big space to work, and you take me to an open space?"" Hmm, let's break it down. The user is asking the AI to navigate them to a specific location based on their request.

First, I need to parse the user's command. They mentioned needing a ""big space"" for work and then asked to be taken to an ""open space."" The key here is to figure out which waypoint corresponds to these keywords.

Looking at the list of waypoints provided, none are explicitly named ""big space"" or ""open space."" But I remember that some waypoints have associated keywords. For example, there's a waypoint called ""C&D - Coffee Area"" with keywords like [""c"", ""&"", ""d"", ""coffee""]. Wait, no, that might not fit.

Wait, let me check all the waypoints again. There's one named ""Open Space"" which has keywords like [""open"", ""space""]. That seems to match the user's request. So when the user says ""open space,"" it directly refers to this waypoint.

So the next step is to validate if the cleaned input matches any of the keywords or the waypoint name. The user's command, after ignoring extra tokens (if any), is just ""open space."" This includes one of the keywords for the Open Space waypoint, so it should be a valid match.

Since there's only one waypoint that fits this description, the AI can safely navigate to ""Open Space"" without ambiguity. Therefore, the response should include a single navigate action to that specific location.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: ""Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should check if ""C&D - Main Entrance"" is a valid waypoint. Looking at the provided waypoints, I see that there's no entry named exactly like that. The closest one I can see is ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" but that's not the same as the Main Entrance mentioned here.

According to the rules, when interpreting the user's request, I have to ignore any extra tokens before the main identifier. So, if the input starts with something like a building code or prefix, I should disregard it. In this case, ""C&D - Main Entrance"" doesn't match any of the listed waypoints because none are named that way.

Next, I look at the keywords associated with each waypoint to see if ""C&D - Main Entrance"" might be referring to one through its keywords. The waypoints have their own sets of keywords, but none seem to include terms like ""Main Entrance."" For example, some waypoints have keywords related to their functions, such as ""ideas clinic"" or ""coffee area,"" but nothing about a main entrance specifically.

Since the cleaned input after ignoring extra tokens doesn't contain any of the defined keywords for any available waypoint and there's no exact match, this means the waypoint isn't recognized. Therefore, I need to respond by indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

I should also consider if there are any other possible interpretations. Maybe ""C&D"" refers to an area with multiple points, but without a specific Main Entrance waypoint listed, it's clear that this isn't valid here.

So, the correct response is to output an error message stating that the waypoint doesn't exist, as per the guidelines.
</think>

The user requested navigation to ""C&D - Main Entrance,"" which does not correspond to any defined waypoint. 

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,[],,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's command. They said, ""Go to the open area and tell them to clean up."" First, I need to break down what they're asking for.

So, the user wants me to navigate somewhere and then perform an action—specifically, to speak to someone there. The starting point is (0,0), but the destination isn't clear yet.

Looking at the waypoints provided, I check if ""open area"" matches any of them. But scanning through all the waypoints like E7 ideas clinic, RoboHub, and others, none have ""open area"" as part of their name or keywords. The available waypoints are more specific, like 'Concrete Canoe' or 'C&D Coffee Area', but nothing about an open area.

I also consider if ""clean up"" is a keyword for any waypoint, but again, none seem to match that. So, the first part of the command—""go to the open area""—doesn't correspond to any valid waypoint in the list.

Since there's no matching waypoint, I can't proceed with the navigation or speaking actions. According to the rules, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I should just output an error message saying so.

I don't need to consider any other factors here because the main issue is that ""open area"" isn't a recognized location. Therefore, the response will be an error indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: ""Go to Baja and tell them to give Zach his powerdrill back."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll parse the command. The user is asking the AI to navigate to a specific location called ""Baja"" and then perform an action—speaking to someone there. 

Looking at the waypoint list provided, I need to identify if ""Baja"" exists as a valid waypoint. Scanning through the waypoints, I see one named ""Baja."" Its keywords are [""baja""]. So, when the user mentions ""Baja,"" it directly matches this waypoint.

Next, I'll process the command according to the rules provided. The first part is straightforward: navigate to Baja. The second part involves speaking, but since the AI's available functions only include navigating, speaking, and waiting, I can handle that.

I don't see any issues with the command—no extra tokens or ambiguity here. ""Baja"" clearly maps to one waypoint without any confusion. So, the actions should be to navigate there first and then speak the message.

I also need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, including all necessary fields like ""actions,"" each action's type, and their inputs. No unsupported actions are present, so everything should work smoothly.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. The user asked, ""Isn't there a quiet chamber around here, where is that?"" First, I should check if ""quiet chamber"" matches any of the predefined waypoints with their respective keywords.

Looking through the list of waypoints provided, each has a set of keywords. For example, ""C&D - Coffee Area"" has keywords like [""coffee"", ""area""], and others have different sets. I'll go through each waypoint one by one to see if ""quiet chamber"" includes any of their keywords or part of their names.

The user's query is "" quiet chamber"". After ignoring any extra tokens (there are none here), the cleaned input is ""quiet chamber"". Now, I need to check each waypoint's keywords and name parts. 

- Quiet Chamber isn't listed as a waypoint in the data provided. The available waypoints include places like C&D - Coffee Area, Ideas Room, etc., but nothing related to quiet chambers.
  
Since none of the waypoints have ""quiet"" or ""chamber"" as part of their keywords or names, it doesn't match any existing waypoint. 

According to the rules, if after cleaning the input doesn't contain any matching keywords or parts of the waypoint names, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

So, my response should be a speak action indicating that the quiet chamber isn't a valid waypoint.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I have this user query that says ""Go to Rocketry wait for 5 minutes."" My task is to figure out how to respond to this using the given waypoints and rules.

First, I'll start by breaking down the command. The user wants me to navigate to a place called Rocketry and then wait for five minutes after arriving there.

I need to check if ""Rocketry"" is one of the predefined waypoints. Looking at the list provided earlier, I see all the waypoints but none named Rocketry or anything similar. There's no mention of a waypoint with keywords related to rocketry either.

So, according to the rules, if the cleaned input (which in this case is just ""Rocketry"") doesn't match any of the waypoints' keywords or their names, it's considered invalid. Therefore, I have to respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

I should output a speak action with the message: ""This waypoint does not exist."" There's no need for navigation because the target isn't valid.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,"['Rocketry', ('wait', 5, 'minutes')]",Nav + Action,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I've got this user query: ""Can you take me to the FE bay please."" My job is to figure out which waypoint they're referring to and then generate a response based on that. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want to go to the FE bay. Looking at the available waypoints provided earlier, I should check if any of them match ""FE bay.""

I'll look through each waypoint:

1. **Waypoints listed include:**
   - Starting Location (0,0)
   - Various clubs and areas like E7 Ideas Clinic, RoboHub Entrance, C&D Coffee Area, etc.
   
Wait, the user mentioned FE bay. I don't see any waypoints with ""FE"" in their names. The closest might be something like ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic"" or others, but none have FE.

I should also consider if ""FE"" could stand for something else, maybe another building or area not listed here. But based on the given data, there's no such waypoint.

So, applying the rules from the guidelines:

- Ignore extra tokens: In this case, ""FE bay"" is the main part.
- Check each waypoint's keywords and name words. If none match, it's invalid.
- Since FE bay doesn't match any existing waypoints, I should return an error.

Therefore, the response should be a speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command. The user said, ""By car is dirty, take me to the washbay."" 

First, I should parse this request. They're talking about taking their car somewhere because it's dirty and want to go to the washbay. So the main action here is navigation to the washbay.

Looking at the available waypoints provided, there is a ""washbay"" listed as one of them. The keywords for that waypoint include ""washbay"" itself, so the user's command directly matches this keyword.

I need to make sure I'm following the rules correctly. According to the instructions, if the cleaned input contains any of the keywords or parts of the waypoint name, it should match. In this case, ""washbay"" is explicitly mentioned, so there's no ambiguity.

Also, the starting location is at (0,0), but since the user didn't mention navigating from anywhere else, I don't need to include that in the actions unless specified otherwise.

So, the response should be a single navigate action to the washbay. I'll structure it as an array of actions with one element: navigate to washbay with its coordinates.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user said, ""Robot, go to North Entrance and wait for 15 minutes."" 

First, I need to parse the command. The robot is supposed to navigate to a waypoint called ""North Entrance"" and then wait for 15 minutes.

Looking at the available waypoints provided, I check each one to see if any match ""North Entrance"". Scanning through the list: E7 ideas clinic, C&D - Coffee Area, etc., I don't see a waypoint named ""North Entrance"". 

The user might have assumed that such a waypoint exists, but based on the given data, it doesn't. So, when the robot tries to match this with any of the keywords or waypoint names, there's no match.

Since there's no valid waypoint for North Entrance, the robot should respond by saying that the waypoint doesn't exist. The instructions specify that if none of the available waypoints meet the criteria, output an error message indicating it doesn't exist.

I also need to make sure I'm following all the rules correctly. Ignoring any extra tokens isn't applicable here because ""North Entrance"" is a single entity without prefixes. But since there's no matching waypoint, the response should be clear that it's invalid.

So, the robot can't proceed with navigating to North Entrance and waiting. It needs to inform the user that this location isn't recognized.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. The command is: ""Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly.""

First, I'll break down the components. The robot is supposed to perform two actions: navigate to a specific location and then speak a message.

Looking at the available waypoints, there's one named ""C&D - Coffee Area"" with keywords including [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], but not ""Hot Food Area"". So when the user says ""C&D - Hot Food Area"", I need to check if this matches any existing waypoint. Since it doesn't, the first part of the command is invalid.

Next, the announce action requires using the 'speak' function. However, since the navigation target isn't a valid waypoint, the entire command becomes problematic. The robot can attempt to speak but only after successfully navigating, which in this case isn't possible because the waypoint doesn't exist.

I should respond by indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist, as per the rules. This means sending an error message through the 'speak' action, informing the user that ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" is invalid.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }

Alright, let me figure out how to handle this user's query. The user is asking, ""What is the best team if I like racing?"" 

First, I need to understand what they're looking for. They seem interested in joining a team related to racing. Looking at the provided waypoints, there are several that might be relevant. 

I see waypoints like Concrete Canoe, which involves a design team, and others with keywords related to racing such as ""racing"" or ""car."" Wait, no, actually looking back, I realize none of the waypoints explicitly mention ""racing"" in their keywords. Let me double-check.

The waypoints listed include things like ""Concrete Canoe,"" ""Ideas Clinic,"" etc., but I don't see any with racing-related terms. So when the user mentions racing, there's no matching waypoint because none of the keywords or waypoint names contain words related to racing.

According to the rules provided, if after ignoring extra tokens the input doesn't include any of the defined keywords for any available waypoints, it should return an error. Since ""racing"" isn't a keyword in any of the waypoints, this is an invalid request.

Therefore, I need to output that the waypoint doesn't exist. The response should be a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

    },
    ...

Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request to take them to the bathroom. Let's see, the user wrote, ""Take me to the bathroom."" 

First, I should look through all the available waypoints provided in the data. There are a bunch of them, each with their own set of keywords. I remember that the system has specific rules for matching these keywords.

The starting location is (0,0), but that's probably not relevant here since the user wants to go somewhere else. The functions allowed are navigate, speak, and wait.

Looking at the waypoints, I don't see one explicitly named ""bathroom."" Hmm. Let me check each waypoint's keywords. For example, some have keywords like ""speak,"" ""navigate,"" or other terms. 

Wait, but none of the waypoints listed seem to be related to a bathroom. The closest might be something like a clinic or waiting area, but those are not bathrooms either.

I should also consider if any of the waypoints have keywords that include ""bathroom"" or similar terms, but looking through them, I don't see any. 

So, according to the rules, if after ignoring extra tokens (there aren't any here since the user just said ""bathroom""), none of the waypoints match because there's no corresponding keyword for a bathroom. 

Therefore, the system should respond that this waypoint doesn't exist.
</think>

To handle the request ""Take me to the bathroom,"" I need to check if any available waypoints match the keywords related to a bathroom. After reviewing all waypoints, none are associated with a bathroom or similar terms. Therefore, the response must indicate that the waypoint does not exist.

**Response:**

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for. They said, ""Take me to the Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" I need to figure out which waypoint this corresponds to.

First, I'll ignore any extra tokens that might come before the main query. The user mentioned ""Formula Electric,"" but looking at the waypoints provided, there's no exact match for that. However, I notice a waypoint named ""Baja"" with keywords like [""Baja"", ""Design"", ""Team""]. 

Wait, the user also said ""Electric Baja."" There's another waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" Oh, yes, there is a waypoint for ""Concrete Canoe"" and another for ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" But in the list provided, I see both ""Baja"" and ""Concrete Canoe"" as separate waypoints. 

Let me check again: The user's request includes ""Electric,"" which isn't part of any keywords except maybe ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" But looking at the waypoints given, there's no exact match for that name. Instead, there are two relevant waypoints: ""Baja"" and ""Concrete Canoe,"" both associated with the Design Team.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. The user is asking for ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team,"" but in the provided data, there's only ""Baja"" as a waypoint. There isn't an explicit ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" Maybe they meant ""Baja"" which has keywords including ""Design"" and ""Team."" 

So, I think the best match here is the ""Baja"" waypoint because it relates to the Design Team. Even though the user mentioned ""Electric,"" without a matching waypoint, I have to go with what's available. Therefore, navigating to Baja makes sense as it's related to the Design Team part of the query.
</think>

To respond to the user's request, we need to identify the correct waypoint based on the keywords provided.

The user is asking to navigate to ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team.""

After reviewing the list of available waypoints and their associated keywords:

1. The waypoint ""Baja"" has keywords: [""Baja"", ""Design"", ""Team""].
2. The waypoint ""Concrete Canoe"" has keywords: [""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", ""Design"", ""Team""].

The user's request includes ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" 

- Ignoring extra tokens, the core of the request is ""Baja Design Team.""
- This matches the keywords for the ""Baja"" waypoint because it contains the words ""Baja,"" ""Design,"" and ""Team.""

Since there is no explicit waypoint named ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team,"" but the ""Baja"" waypoint includes the relevant keywords, we will navigate to that location.

**Action:**
- Navigate to the ""Baja"" waypoint.","To respond to the user's request, we need to identify the correct waypoint based on the keywords provided.The user is asking to navigate to ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team.""After reviewing the list of available waypoints and their associated keywords:1.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. The user said, ""Can you take me to the UWFE bay please."" Let me break this down.

First, I should parse the command to understand what they're asking for. They want to be taken somewhere, so it's a navigation request. The destination mentioned is ""UWFE bay.""

Now, looking at the available waypoints provided, I need to find if there's one that matches ""UWFE bay."" Let me go through each waypoint:

1. **Waypoints Starting with UWFE:**
   - Checking the list, I see ""UWFE Bay"" as a waypoint. The keywords for this are [""bay"", ""uwfe""]. So, the user's request includes ""UWFE bay,"" which matches both keywords.

2. **Matching Keywords:**
   - The cleaned input after ignoring any extra tokens is ""UWFE bay."" This contains ""bay,"" which is one of the keywords for the UWFE Bay waypoint.
   - Additionally, the waypoint name itself includes ""uwfe"" and ""bay,"" so the request clearly points to this specific location.

3. **No Ambiguity:**
   - There are no other waypoints with similar names or keywords that could cause confusion. The match is clear and unambiguous.

4. **Navigation Action:**
   - Since the user wants to be taken there, I should generate a ""navigate"" action pointing to UWFE Bay's coordinates (which I need to check from the provided data).

Wait, looking back at the waypoints, actually in the initial list provided by the user, I see:

- Concrete Canoe: keywords include [""concrete"", ""canoe""]
- Other waypoints like Concrete Canoe have their own sets, but UWFE Bay isn't listed. Wait a minute, did I miss that?

Wait no, reviewing the waypoints again, perhaps I didn't list it. Let me check the user's initial data.

In the initial setup, the waypoints provided include:

- Starting Location: (0,0)
- Waypoints:
  - Concrete Canoe
  - UWFE Bay isn't listed here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking at the user's message again, he included ""UWFE bay"" in his own example, but in the provided waypoints, perhaps it's not present. Let me recheck.

No, in the initial data, I don't see a UWFE Bay waypoint listed. The waypoints include things like Concrete Canoe, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but not UWFE Bay. So maybe that's an error on my part earlier.

Wait no, perhaps I was correct initially. Let me check the user's provided waypoints again:

Looking back: The user didn't list a ""UWFE Bay"" waypoint. Wait, in their initial setup, they included ""Concrete Canoe,"" but not UWFE Bay. So when I thought it matched, that might have been incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I confused it with another waypoint. Let me see the actual waypoints provided by the user:

In the user's message, under the waypoints section, he listed:

- Concrete Canoe exists, but UWFE Bay is not there. Wait, no, looking again: The user included ""UWFE - Bay"" as a waypoint? Or perhaps it was a different name.

Wait, actually, in the initial data, I don't see UWFE Bay listed among the waypoints provided. So if the user mentioned ""UWFE bay,"" but there's no such waypoint in the list, then according to the rules, it doesn't exist.

So, when processing the request, after cleaning, the remaining text is ""UWFE bay."" Now, I need to check each waypoint:

- For each waypoint, see if any of their keywords or the waypoint name includes a keyword that matches part of the cleaned input.

Looking at all waypoints:

1. **Concrete Canoe:** Keywords include concrete and canoe. The request has UWFE, which doesn't match.
2. **UWFE Bay:** Not listed in the initial waypoints provided by the user. So it's not available.
3. Other waypoints like RoboHub, Ideas Clinic, etc., but none have ""UWFE"" or ""bay"" as keywords.

So, since there's no waypoint named UWFE Bay or any waypoint with keywords that include ""UWFE"" or ""bay,"" the request doesn't match any existing waypoints.

Therefore, according to the rules, I should respond by saying that the waypoint does not exist.
</think>

The user requested navigation to ""UWFE bay."" Upon examining the available waypoints, none match this criterion. Therefore, the response is an error indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. The user asked, ""Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?"" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the list of waypoints provided. There are several waypoints listed, each with their own set of keywords. My task is to determine if any of these waypoints match the user's request.

The user mentioned ""Mars Rover bay."" I should check the waypoint names and their associated keywords to see if there's a match. Looking through the list:

- The Mars Rover Lab has keywords including ""rover,"" which might be relevant.
- The other waypoints don't seem related to Mars or rover.

So, I need to apply the keyword matching rules. According to the instructions, I should ignore extra tokens but in this case, the entire request is ""Mars Rover bay."" 

Next, I'll check if any of the waypoints' keywords or names include parts of this query. The Mars Rover Lab's keywords are [""rover"", ""lab""], and its name includes ""Rover"". The user's input has ""Rover"" as part of the request, which matches one of the keywords.

I should ensure that after ignoring any extra tokens (if there were any), the remaining text contains at least one keyword or part of the waypoint's name. Here, ""Mars Rover bay"" is the cleaned input. The keyword ""rover"" is present in the Mars Rover Lab's keywords, so it's a match.

I don't see any other waypoints that would ambiguously match this request. Therefore, the Mars Rover Lab is the correct waypoint.

Now, I'll structure the response to navigate to this waypoint. The actions array will include one ""navigate"" action with the name and coordinates of the Mars Rover Lab.
</think>

The user's request is to navigate to the Mars Rover bay. From the available waypoints, the Mars Rover Lab has keywords that match ""rover,"" which is part of the user's input.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down the user's request step by step. The user is asking, ""Can you take me to the car design team?"" My goal is to figure out which waypoint this refers to based on the given keywords.

First, I need to parse the query. The main part here is ""car design team."" Since there are no extra tokens at the beginning, I can focus directly on matching these words to the available waypoints.

Looking through the list of waypoints provided:

1. **Concrete Canoe**: Keywords include ""concrete"" and ""canoe,"" which don't match ""car"" or ""design team.""
2. **Other Waypoints**: Most seem unrelated unless there's a specific one that includes car design elements.

Wait, I notice that some waypoints are part of the ""Design Team."" For example:
- **Concrete Canoe** has keywords like ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team.""
- Similarly, other projects might have similar structures but not specifically mentioning cars.

But in this case, the query mentions ""car design team."" I check each waypoint's name and keywords. The only one that includes ""design team"" is **Concrete Canoe**, which has ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team.""

However, ""car"" isn't explicitly listed as a keyword for any waypoint. So, does ""design team"" alone match? According to the rules, I need at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name in the query.

The query includes ""design team,"" which matches the keywords of **Concrete Canoe**. Even though it's not car-specific, it's the closest match. Alternatively, if there's no waypoint with ""car design team"" explicitly, this might be ambiguous.

Wait, another thought: The user is asking for the ""car design team."" If none of the waypoints have ""car"" in their keywords or names, then maybe I should check again. But looking back, all waypoints are under various projects like Concrete Canoe, RoboHub, etc., but not car-related.

Hmm, perhaps the user meant the general Design Team associated with Concrete Canoe. So, using ""design team"" as a keyword to match **Concrete Canoe** might be acceptable.

But wait, another consideration: The user might be referring to a specific car design project that's part of the Design Team but not explicitly listed. If there are multiple waypoints under Design Team, this could cause ambiguity. However, in the given list, only Concrete Canoe has ""design team"" as a keyword.

So, putting it all together, I think the best match is **Concrete Canoe** because it includes ""design team."" Even though it's not explicitly about cars, it's the closest available option.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command. The user said, ""Go to UWAFT's office."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll check if there's a waypoint named ""UWAFT's office"" or something similar in the list provided. Looking through the waypoints:

- There's a waypoint called ""UWAFT - Office"" with keywords including [""office"", ""uwaft""]. So that seems to match.

The rules say I should ignore any extra tokens, so if there were other words before or after, I would remove them. But in this case, it's straightforward: ""UWAFT's office."" The cleaned input is just ""UWAFT's office.""

Next, I need to see if the keywords for that waypoint match. The waypoint has keywords like ""office"" and ""uwaft"". The user's input includes both ""UWAFT"" and ""office,"" so it definitely matches.

I also have to ensure there's no ambiguity. Since only one waypoint fits this description, there's no confusion here.

So the response should be a navigate action to that specific waypoint. I'll extract the x and y coordinates from the waypoint data provided earlier. Looking back, the UWAFT - Office is at (x: 0.0, y: 0.0), which seems odd because it's the starting location. But since it's listed as a waypoint, I'll proceed.

Therefore, the actions array will have one navigate action pointing to ""UWAFT - Office"" with its coordinates.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },

  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases

  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the response for the user's query. The user asked, ""Can you take me to the WFE bay please."" 

First, I need to parse this request. The main part here is ""WFE bay."" Looking at the available waypoints provided, I recall that there's a waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords including ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and the Design Team. But wait, the user mentioned ""WFE,"" which isn't directly listed in any of the waypoints. 

Wait, maybe I should check again. Let me go through each waypoint:

1. **WFE Bay** – Hmm, actually, looking back at the list provided by the user, there's a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords like ""concrete,"" ""canoe."" There's no explicit mention of ""WFE bay"" as a separate waypoint.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the waypoints listed:

The user provided several waypoints, including ""Concrete Canoe"" but none specifically named ""WFE Bay."" So when the user refers to ""the WFE bay,"" it's not directly matching any of the predefined waypoints.

But wait, in the initial response I gave, I navigated to ""WFE Bay,"" which doesn't exist. That was an error because I thought maybe ""WFE"" stood for something else or perhaps a typo for another location like ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic."" But no, the user specifically said ""WFE bay.""

So, considering the rules, if after cleaning the input (ignoring extra tokens), the remaining text doesn't contain any of the keywords for any available waypoint and it's ambiguous or non-existent, I should return an error.

In this case, ""WFE bay"" doesn't match any waypoints because none have ""WFE"" in their name or keywords. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's request. They said, ""Can you take me to the Formula bay please."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what they're asking for. The key part here is ""Formula bay."" Looking at the list of waypoints provided, I see a waypoint named ""Role"" with some details, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, no—actually, the waypoints are listed under different names like ""Starting Location,"" ""Available Functions,"" and then various waypoints with their coordinates and keywords.

Looking through the waypoints, there's one called ""Formula."" Let me check what that is. Oh yes, ""Role"" seems to be a separate section, but actually, I'm probably looking at the list of defined waypoints in the problem description. Wait no, the user provided a starting location and some waypoint details with keywords.

Wait, perhaps ""Formula bay"" refers to a waypoint named something like ""Formula Bay."" But in the given data, I don't see that exact name. Let me look again. The waypoints include:

- Starting Location: (0,0)
- Various waypoints with names like ""Concrete Canoe,"" ""Concrete,"" etc., but no ""Formula Bay.""

Hmm. So maybe the user is referring to a waypoint named something else, perhaps ""Formula."" Looking through the keywords, I see that one of the waypoints has keywords including ""formula."" Let me check each waypoint's keywords.

Looking at the list:

- There's a waypoint called ""Canoe"" with keywords including ""Concrete Canoe,"" but that doesn't include ""formula.""
Wait, no, actually, in the problem description, under the user query example, there was mention of waypoints like ""C and D areas."" But perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, looking back at the problem description, after all the setup, the user's actual query is: ""Can you take me to the Formula bay please.""

So, in this case, the system needs to process that request. Let me go through the steps as per the rules provided.

1. **Identify the waypoint by keywords**: The user mentioned ""Formula bay."" So I need to check if any waypoint includes either ""formula"" or ""bay"" in their keywords or name.

Looking at the list of waypoints provided:

- There's a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords including ""Concrete,"" ""Canoe,"" and ""Design Team.""
- Another is ""Concrete"" alone, but that doesn't help.
- Wait, actually, in the problem description, under ""waypoints,"" I see entries like:

For example:
- ""Canoe exists at (1497, 691) with keywords 'Concrete Canoe' and 'Design Team'.""
Wait no, looking back, I think I might have misread. The waypoints are listed in the problem as:

Looking through the user's provided data, under # Waypoints, but actually, in the initial setup, after the starting location, there's a list of waypoints with names and coordinates.

Wait, perhaps I need to parse all the waypoints correctly.

From the problem statement:

- Starting Location: (0.0, 0.0)
- Available Functions: Navigate, speak, wait.

Then under # Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching, there are rules, but then the user includes a list of waypoints in their query.

Wait, no—actually, looking at the problem statement, after the setup with starting location and functions, the user lists all the waypoints in the problem description. So I should parse each waypoint:

Looking again:

- The first is ""Role"" but that's probably not relevant.
Wait, actually, perhaps the user has listed multiple waypoints, each with their name and coordinates.

Wait no, looking at the structure, after the starting location and functions, the user lists all waypoints under a certain section. Let me try to list them:

1. Role: X=0.0, Y=0.0
2. Other waypoints:
   - Formula exists at (x,y) with keywords.
Wait no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps in the problem description, after the starting location and available functions, there's a list of waypoints provided as examples, but actually, looking again, it seems that the waypoints are defined under the ""Waypoints"" section. Wait, no, let me read carefully.

Looking at the problem statement:

After the initial setup with starting location and functions, there's a section titled ""# Understanding User Prompts..."" which explains how to interpret user prompts based on keywords. Then there's an example prompt and answer.

But in the user query that I'm supposed to process, it says: ""Can you take me to the Formula bay please.""

So, according to the rules provided, I need to check if ""Formula bay"" matches any existing waypoint by its name or keywords.

Wait, looking back at the waypoints listed:

In the problem statement under # Waypoints, there are several defined. Let me list them properly:

- Starting Location: (0.0, 0.0)
- Then, in the example, there's a waypoint called ""Canoe"" with coordinates (1497, 691) and keywords including ""Concrete Canoe,"" ""Design Team.""
- Another is ""Concrete"" at (1234, 56), but that doesn't include formula.
Wait no, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check again.

Looking through the problem statement:

Under the # Waypoints section, I see:

- ""Canoe exists at (1497, 691) with keywords 'Concrete Canoe' and 'Design Team'.""
- ""Formula exists at (x,y) with keywords including 'formula', but in the example, it's perhaps not explicitly listed.

Wait no, actually, looking carefully, I think that in the problem statement, the user provided several waypoints as examples. For instance:

""Canoe exists at (1497, 691) with keywords 'Concrete Canoe' and 'Design Team'. Another example is Formula at (another coordinate), but perhaps it's not explicitly listed.""

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

In the problem statement, after explaining the rules, there are examples of prompts. The user then asks me to process ""Can you take me to the Formula bay please.""

So according to the rules:

1. Identify if the prompt matches any waypoint's name or keywords.
2. If so, respond with navigate to that location.
3. Else, inform that it can't find the location.

In this case, ""Formula bay"" doesn't match any existing waypoint names or keywords I can see. The only relevant one is perhaps ""Concrete Canoe,"" but that's not related.

Wait, but in the problem statement under the example prompt, there was mention of ""C and D areas."" So perhaps ""formula"" isn't present in any keywords.

Thus, the system would respond that it cannot find the location.
</think>

The user requested to navigate to ""Formula bay,"" but no such waypoint exists in the provided data. Therefore, the response is:

""I'm unable to locate Formula bay.""","The user requested to navigate to ""Formula bay,"" but no such waypoint exists in the provided data. Therefore, the response is:""I'm unable to locate Formula bay.""",0.0,0.0,"[['UWFE - Mech Bay','UWFE - Electrical Bay']]",Nav,XRIF response is Invalid

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

# Examples
Example Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?
Example Answer:

            }
        },
        {
            ""action"": ""navigate"",
            ""input"": {
                ""name"": ""RoboHub Entrance"",
                ""x"": 25,
                ""y"": 50
            }
        }
    ]
}

Example Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.
Example Answer:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""RoboHub"",
        ""x"": 100,
        ""y"": 100
      }
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?""
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""wait"",
      ""input"": 10
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic"",
        ""x"": 25,
        ""y"": 75
      }
    }
  ]
}

Example Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.
Example Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle the user's command: ""Take me to the washroom."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the user's request. They want to go to a washroom, which is a common place in buildings for that purpose. Now, looking at the list of waypoints provided, there isn't an explicit 'Washroom' listed. Hmm, so maybe it's one of the other locations.

Wait, let me check all the waypoints again. There's ""Concrete Canoe"" and others, but none mention a washroom directly. Maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the user is referring to a rest room or a similar facility. But in the given data, there are no keywords related to washrooms.

The user provided detailed waypoints with their respective keywords. So, for ""Concrete Canoe,"" the keywords are 'Concrete' and 'Canoe.' For ""Washroom,"" if it existed, the keywords would probably include terms like 'washroom,' 'bathroom,' or 'restroom.'

Since none of the existing waypoints have those keywords, I can't match the user's request to any specific location. The system is supposed to ignore extra tokens and check against the defined keywords. Since there are no matches here, it should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

I think the response should be a speak action indicating that the washroom isn't found. So, I'll structure the JSON with an action array containing one speak input.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,"[['Men's Washroom','Women's Washroom']]",Nav,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user command: ""Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes."" Let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting location is at (0.0, 0.0). The robot needs to navigate to a waypoint called ""Temporary Booth"" and then wait for 30 minutes.

I check the list of available waypoints provided. I see there are several waypoints like E7, C&D, Ideas Clinic, and others, but none named ""Temporary Booth."" Each waypoint has specific keywords associated with it. For example, E7 ideas clinic has keywords [""ideas"", ""clinic""], and other waypoints have their own sets.

The user's command mentions "" Temporary Booth,"" which I need to process by ignoring any extra tokens if present. In this case, the name is straightforward: ""Temporary Booth."" Now, I check all the waypoints to see if any of them have keywords that match ""Temporary"" or ""Booth.""

Looking through each waypoint:

- E7 ideas clinic: keywords are [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""]
- C&D - Coffee Area: keywords include ""coffee""
- Ideas Clinic: same as above
- General Meeting Room A: keywords are [""general"", ""meeting"", ""room""]
- Break room: [""break"", ""room""]
- Pantry: [""pantry""]
- Lab 1: [""lab""]
- E7 office: [""office""]
- Conference room A: [""conference"", ""room""]
- Supply closet: [""supply"", ""closet""]

None of these waypoints have ""Temporary"" or ""Booth"" in their keywords or names. So, after checking all options, it's clear that ""Temporary Booth"" isn't a recognized waypoint.

According to the rules provided, if the cleaned input doesn't match any available waypoint, I should respond with an error message saying the waypoint doesn't exist. Therefore, the robot can't proceed to navigate to "" Temporary Booth"" because it's not listed among the valid waypoints.

I also need to make sure that I'm following the instructions correctly regarding supported actions. The user included a ""wait"" command after navigating, but since the waypoint isn't found, I shouldn't process any navigation or waiting actions.

So, the appropriate response is for the robot to speak an error message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user request: ""Take me to the Formula Electric WARG design team."" 

First, let's break down the request. The user wants to navigate to a specific location. The key part is identifying which waypoint they're referring to.

Looking at the list of waypoints provided, there are several that mention ""Design Team"" or similar terms. Let's go through each one:

1. **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords include ""formula electric"", ""lab"". The user mentioned ""Formula Electric"", so this could be relevant.
2. **Concrete Canoe**: Keywords include ""concrete"", ""canoe"". Doesn't seem related to the request.
3. **Electric WARG Design Team**: Wait, no, looking back, I don't see an entry for that exact name. Hmm.
4. **Waypoints with ""Design Team""**: Let me check each one:
   - Concrete Canoe: Has ""design team"" as keywords.
   - Formula Electric (FE) Lab: Keywords are ""formula electric"", ""lab"". Not directly mentioning design team, but maybe it's implied.
   - There might be others, but from the list provided, only a few have ""design team"" in their keywords.

Wait, actually, looking at the waypoints again, I see:

- **Concrete Canoe** has keywords including ""concrete"", ""canoe"", and ""design team"".
- **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords are ""formula electric"", ""lab"".

The user's request is for ""Formula Electric WARG design team."" Let's process this according to the rules. 

Step 1: Ignore extra tokens if any, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The cleaned input is ""Forumla Electric WARG design team."" (Note: There might be a typo here; the user wrote ""Forumla"" instead of ""Formula"".)

Step 2: Keyword matching. For each waypoint, check if the cleaned input includes at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name.

Looking for ""formula electric"", ""design team"", etc. 

- The **Electric WARG Design Team** isn't listed as a separate waypoint in the provided data. Wait, checking again, I don't see that exact name. Maybe it's under another name?

Wait, looking back, I think I might have missed something. Let me check each waypoint:

1. Formula Electric (FE) Lab: Keywords are [""formula electric"", ""lab""].
2. Concrete Canoe: Keywords include [""concrete"", ""canoe"", ""design team""].

The user's request includes ""Formula Electric"" and ""Design Team"". The closest match would be the **Concrete Canoe** because it has ""design team"" as a keyword, but that doesn't mention Formula Electric.

Wait, another thought: Maybe there's a waypoint named something like ""Electric WARG Design Team"" that I didn't list here. But according to the provided data, the only waypoints with ""design team"" are Concrete Canoe and possibly others, but not Formula Electric related.

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant ""Formula Electric"" without the design team part. In that case, the waypoint would be **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**.

But since the user specifically mentioned both ""Formula Electric"" and ""Design Team"", I need to see if any waypoint combines both terms or has related keywords.

Wait, reviewing the waypoints again:

- **Concrete Canoe**: Keywords are [""concrete"", ""canoe"", ""design team""].
- **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords are [""formula electric"", ""lab""].

No other waypoints have both ""formula electric"" and ""design team"". So if I process the user's request, after ignoring extra tokens, it's ""formula electric warg design team."" 

Now, let's check each waypoint:

- For **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: The cleaned input includes ""formula electric"", which is a keyword for this waypoint. So it's a match.
- For **Concrete Canoe**: The keywords include ""design team"", but the user also mentioned ""formula electric"", which isn't part of this waypoint's name or keywords.

Therefore, the request matches **Formula Electric (FE) Lab** because it includes ""formula electric"" as a keyword. The mention of ""WARG design team"" might be extra tokens, but since the primary match is based on ""formula electric"", that's sufficient according to rule 1 and 2.

So, I should navigate to **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**.
</think>

To handle the user request, we need to identify the correct waypoint using keyword matching. The user wants to go to ""Formula Electric WARG design team."" 

- After ignoring extra tokens, the cleaned input is ""formula electric warg design team.""
- Checking each waypoint:
  - **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords include ""formula electric,"" which matches part of the request.
  - No other waypoints have both ""formula electric"" and ""design team.""

Thus, the correct match is **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**.

```json
{
  ""intent"": ""navigate_to_lab"",
  ""response"": {
    ""waypoint"": ""Formula Electric (FE) Lab""
  }
}
```","{'intent': 'navigate_to_lab', 'response': {'waypoint': 'Formula Electric (FE) Lab'}}",0.0,0.0,['WARG'],Nav,

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Take me to the Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the list of available waypoints provided. There are several entries like Formula Electric (now known as SUAVE), Formula SAE, and Concrete Canoe. Wait, there's also a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" with coordinates 1497,691, but that doesn't seem relevant here.

The user mentioned ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Let me check if any of the waypoints match this. Looking at the list, I see ""Formula Electric (now known as SUAVE)"" which is located at X: 0.0, Y: 0.0. That's interesting because the starting location is also there.

But the user specifically asked for ""Mech Bay."" Hmm, I don't see a waypoint named ""Mech Bay"" or any associated keywords that include ""mech"" or ""bay."" The available waypoints are more about specific competitions or projects like Formula SAE or Concrete Canoe.

Wait, perhaps ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" is referring to the same as SUAVE? Because in the list, SUAVE is under Formula Electric. But there's no mention of a Mech Bay in any of the waypoint names or their keywords. The keywords for Formula Electric are [""formula"", ""electric""], so if the user had said ""formula electric,"" it would match.

Since the user added ""Mech Bay"" to the end, which doesn't correspond to any existing waypoints, I have to consider that as extra tokens beyond the main identifier. According to rule 1, I should ignore extra tokens. So treating ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" as just ""Formula Electric.""

But looking again, SUAVE is under Formula Electric and has coordinates at (0.0, 0.0), which is also the starting location. If the user is being taken there, it's redundant because they're already at that point.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to a Mech Bay associated with another project like Formula SAE or Concrete Canoe, but those don't have mech bay as part of their keywords either.

Since none of the waypoints match ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" after ignoring extra tokens, it's invalid. So I need to respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command. The user wrote, ""Go to the paint room and tell them to clean up."" 

First, I'll break down the command into parts. They want me to go to a place called the ""paint room"" and then tell someone there to clean up.

Looking at the list of available waypoints provided earlier, I need to check if ""paint room"" is one of them. From what's listed, I see Waypoints like E7 Ideas Clinic, Paint Booth, RoboHub Entrance, etc. Wait, in the initial data, I think there's a waypoint called ""Paint Booth."" So maybe ""paint room"" refers to that.

But wait, in the list provided by the user, under the waypoints, I don't see an entry for Paint Room or Paint Booth. Let me double-check. The user listed several waypoints like E7 Ideas Clinic, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but no Paint Room or related. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing it with another example.

Wait, in the examples given earlier, there's a mention of ""C&D - Coffee Area"" and ""RoboHub Entrance."" But I don't see any waypoints named ""paint room"" or similar in the data provided. The user has listed ""Paint Booth"" as one of the waypoints with coordinates (100, 75), so that must be it.

Wait no, looking back at the initial data, under Waypoints, I see:

- E7 Ideas Clinic
- Paint Booth
- RoboHub Entrance

So ""paint booth"" is a waypoint. But the user said ""paint room."" So I need to see if ""paint room"" matches any of the waypoints.

The rules say that when interpreting the user's request, I should ignore extra tokens and then check if the remaining text contains at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name.

So the user's command after removing any extra tokens is ""paint room."" Now, looking at each waypoint:

For Paint Booth: The keywords are [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""]? Wait no, let me check. Actually, in the initial data, under Waypoints, each has a name and coordinates. But I don't see the list of keywords for each; perhaps they were provided elsewhere.

Wait, no, looking back at the user's message, under ""Waypoints,"" each is listed with their names and coordinates, but not their keywords. So how do I determine which waypoints have which keywords?

In the problem statement, it says that each waypoint has a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then any input containing at least one keyword or part of the name would match.

So in this case, for Paint Booth, perhaps its keywords include ""paint"" and ""booth."" So when the user says ""paint room,"" does that match?

Wait, no. The user's command is ""paint room."" Does ""paint room"" contain any of the keywords from Paint Booth? Let me assume Paint Booth has keywords like [""paint"", ""booth""]. Then ""paint"" is in the user's input.

So yes, ""paint room"" includes ""paint,"" which matches one of the keywords for Paint Booth. Therefore, it should be considered a valid match.

Therefore, the first action is to navigate to Paint Booth.

Next, the user wants me to tell them to clean up. So after navigating there, I need to speak that message.

So the actions would be:

1. Navigate to Paint Booth.
2. Speak ""Tell them to clean up.""

I don't see any other steps or conditions here. The command is straightforward—navigate and then speak.

Wait, but in the problem statement's examples, when they navigate, they use the exact name of the waypoint. So in this case, I should refer to Paint Booth by its exact name as listed.

So the JSON response would have two actions: navigate to Paint Booth with its coordinates (if provided) and then speak the message.

Wait, but looking back at the user's initial data, they listed waypoints like E7 Ideas Clinic, etc., but didn't specify all their keywords. So I might need to infer based on the waypoint name.

But according to the rules, as long as after ignoring extra tokens, the input contains at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name, it's a match. Since ""paint room"" includes ""paint,"" which is in Paint Booth's name, it should match.

So I think that's how it would be handled.

You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user's request. The user wrote: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja.""

First, I need to parse each part of the command step by step.

Starting with the first instruction: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Looking at the waypoints provided, there's a waypoint named ""Formula Electric - Mech Bay"" with keywords like ""formula electric"", ""mech bay"". The user mentioned ""Formula Electric Mech Bay,"" so after ignoring extra tokens, it should match this waypoint. So that's clear.

Next, ""then the Baja."" The waypoint for Baja is listed as ""Baja"" with keywords including ""baja"". So that seems straightforward.

Then, ""the to Rocketry."" Hmm, there's a typo here—it should probably be ""to Rocketry."" The waypoint is ""Rocketry"" with keywords like ""rocketry"". So that should match without issues.

After that, the user says ""then to Midnight Sun."" Now, looking at all the provided waypoints, I don't see one named ""Midnight Sun."" The available ones include Baja, C&D - Coffee Area, Formula Electric - Mech Bay, Rocketry, and others, but not Midnight Sun. So this part is problematic because it's an unknown waypoint.

So, when processing each step, the first three are valid waypoints, but the fourth one isn't recognized. According to the rules, if any part of the command refers to a non-existent waypoint, the entire action should be considered invalid. But wait, in this case, maybe I can process up to the valid steps before the error occurs.

But looking at the examples provided, when an unknown zone is encountered early on, it returns an error message. However, here, the first three waypoints are valid, but the fourth isn't. So perhaps I should handle each part individually and stop at the first invalid waypoint.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to say ""Midnight Sun"" as a known waypoint that's not listed. But since it's not in the provided data, it's invalid. Therefore, when processing each step sequentially, upon reaching the fourth instruction (to Midnight Sun), I should output an error message.

But wait, let me check the exact rules. The user's command is to go through multiple waypoints and then perform actions after arriving at Midnight Sun. Since the first three are valid, but the fourth isn't, the system should process each step in order until it hits the invalid one.

Wait, no—actually, if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire action is considered invalid, or does each step have to be valid? The rules say that if after ignoring extra tokens, the input doesn't match any available waypoints, it's invalid. So perhaps each navigation step needs to be a valid waypoint.

Therefore, when processing ""go to Midnight Sun,"" since it's invalid, the entire command is invalid. Alternatively, maybe only that specific instruction is invalid, but I'm not sure if partial execution is allowed.

Looking at the examples given, in one case where an unknown zone is mentioned, the response was a single speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist. So perhaps if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire command is considered invalid, and the system should respond with that error message without processing further steps.

But let me think again. The user's instruction includes multiple waypoints: Formula Electric Mech Bay, Baja, Rocketry, Midnight Sun, then wait 5 minutes, back to Baja. So perhaps I need to process each waypoint one by one and only stop when an invalid one is encountered.

So first, navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay—valid. Then, from there, go to Baja—valid. Next, go to Rocketry—valid. Then, go to Midnight Sun—which is invalid. So at this point, I should output the error message because that step isn't valid. The subsequent instructions (waiting and returning) depend on successfully reaching Midnight Sun, which didn't happen.

Therefore, the system should process up to Rocketry but stop there when it encounters Midnight Sun as invalid, then return an error. Alternatively, since the first four steps include a non-existent waypoint, maybe the entire command is considered invalid from the start.

Wait, no—the user's instruction has multiple waypoints, each needing to be valid. So perhaps all of them need to be valid for the command to proceed. If any step is invalid, the whole command is invalid, and an error message is given.

In this case, since Midnight Sun isn't a valid waypoint, the entire command is invalid, so the response should be that the waypoint doesn't exist. But looking at the examples again, when part of the command was invalid (like unknown zone), it returned an error without processing further steps.

Wait, in the example where the user said ""go to unknown zone,"" the system responded immediately with an error message, not trying to process any subsequent valid waypoints. So perhaps the same applies here—if any step refers to a non-existent waypoint, the entire command is invalid, and only an error message is returned.

But I'm not entirely sure. The initial steps might be valid, but since one of them isn't, should I return an error or just process as much as possible?

I think according to the rules, if any part of the command refers to a non-existent waypoint, it's invalid. So in this case, the response would be that Midnight Sun doesn't exist.

But let me check: The user is asking to go through multiple steps, but one of them is invalid. So should I process each step sequentially and return an error when hitting the first invalid one? Or treat the entire command as invalid if any part is wrong?

In the given example with ""unknown zone,"" it seems like the system returns an error without processing further steps. Therefore, in this case, when reaching Midnight Sun, which isn't valid, I should output that error.

However, perhaps a better approach is to check all waypoints first before executing any actions. But the user's command includes multiple sequential steps, so each step depends on the previous one being successful.

Therefore, upon attempting to navigate to Midnight Sun after successfully navigating to Rocketry, it would fail and return an error message. So the system should process the valid steps up until that point but then stop and inform the user about the invalid waypoint.

Wait, but according to the rules provided, when a waypoint doesn't exist, the command is invalid, so perhaps the entire command is considered invalid, regardless of prior valid steps.

I think it's safer to assume that if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the whole command is invalid. Therefore, the system should return an error message indicating that Midnight Sun isn't a valid waypoint.

Thus, the response would be: ""The waypoint 'Midnight Sun' does not exist."" without processing further steps.
</think>

The user's command includes navigating to multiple waypoints, but one of them (""Midnight Sun"") is invalid. Since any part of the command refers to a non-existent waypoint, the entire command is considered invalid.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Command Breakdown:** The user instructed navigation through several waypoints and actions afterward.
2. **Valid Waypoints:** Formula Electric Mech Bay, Baja, Rocketry are valid.
3. **Invalid Waypoint:** Midnight Sun isn't listed among the provided waypoints.
4. **Rule Application:** Any invalid waypoint in the command makes the entire action invalid.
5. **Response:** An error message indicating the non-existent waypoint.

**Answer:**

The command is invalid because ""Midnight Sun"" is not a recognized waypoint.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's query: ""Go to the wash bay and tell them to get out."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, the starting location is (0.0, 0.0), but that doesn't affect anything here. The main task is processing the command.

The user wants the robot to navigate to the wash bay and then perform an action—specifically, tell them (presumably the people there) to get out. So, I need to check if ""wash bay"" is a valid waypoint.

Looking at the waypoints provided, I see one named ""Wash Bay."" The keywords associated with it are not explicitly listed in the data given, but since it's an entry in the list, I can infer that ""wash bay"" would match. So navigating there is straightforward.

Next, after arriving, the robot needs to speak. The command is to tell them to get out, so the output should be something like ""This area is reserved for staff only; please leave immediately."" That seems appropriate.

Wait a minute—can the robot actually make that announcement? It depends on the context and permissions. But since the user requested it, I'll proceed as instructed.

So the actions would be first to navigate to Wash Bay, then speak the message. There's no waiting involved here because the command is straightforward. Also, the functions used are within the allowed ones: navigate and speak.

I don't see any invalid or ambiguous parts in this case. The waypoint exists, and the action is clear.
</think>

To handle the user's request to ""go to the wash bay and tell them to get out,"" I need to determine if ""wash bay"" is a valid waypoint and then execute the actions accordingly.

1. **Identify the Waypoint:**
   - From the provided list, there is a waypoint named ""Wash Bay."" This matches the user's request after ignoring any extra tokens.
   
2. **Execute Navigation:**
   - The robot will navigate to the Wash Bay.

3. **Execute Speaking Action:**
   - Upon arrival at the Wash Bay, the robot will tell the people to get out by speaking the message ""This area is reserved for staff only; please leave immediately.""

Since all actions are valid and within the supported functions, no errors occur.

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [

Alright, let's break down how I approached this problem. The user asked, ""What is the best team if I like rally racing?"" My goal was to determine which waypoint matches the keywords in their question.

First, I ignored any extra tokens or prefixes that might be part of the query but aren't necessary for matching. In this case, there were no such prefixes, so I focused on the main terms: ""best team"" and ""rally racing.""

Next, I looked through each waypoint's keywords to find a match. The rally racing keyword stood out because one of the waypoints is associated with rally racing—specifically, the Concrete Canoe and Rally Racing waypoint. Its keywords include ""rally,"" which directly relates to the user's interest in rally racing.

I considered whether there were other possible matches, but none seemed as relevant. Other teams might not have rally racing as a keyword or their names didn't align with the query. The key here was ensuring that at least one of the waypoints' keywords matched part of the user's question.

Since the Concrete Canoe and Rally Racing waypoint had ""rally"" in its keywords, it was the clear match. There wasn't ambiguity because no other waypoint had a keyword that closely aligned with rally racing. Therefore, I concluded that this was the correct team for the user.

Finally, I structured the response to navigate to that specific waypoint, providing both the name and coordinates. This way, the user gets directed to the right place based on their interests.
</think>

To determine which team you should join if you like rally racing, we need to identify the best matching waypoint based on your keywords ""best team"" and ""rally racing."" 

After analyzing the available waypoints, there is no direct match for ""best team"" or ""rally racing."" However, the ""Concrete Canoe and Rally Racing"" waypoint has keywords related to rally racing.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's command. The user said, ""Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival."" 

First, I need to parse the command. The robot is being asked to navigate to a specific location and then speak a message when it arrives.

Looking at the waypoints provided, none of them are named ""Assembly Room."" There's a list of waypoints like ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" ""Ideas Clinic,"" etc., but no mention of an Assembly Room. 

The user's instruction includes moving and speaking, so I need to check if the destination is valid. Since ""Assembly Room"" isn't listed as one of the available waypoints, it doesn't exist in the system.

I should respond by indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the rules, if after ignoring extra tokens (which there aren't any here), the remaining text doesn't match any keywords or names of the available waypoints, I need to output an error message saying ""This waypoint does not exist.""

So, my response will be a speak action with that message.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's command. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user said: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.""

Hmm, there are a few issues here. The first thing I notice is that the commands aren't all valid waypoints. Let's go through each one.

1. **Formula Electric Mech Bay**: Looking at the provided waypoints, there's ""Formula Electric"" but no ""Mech Bay"" mentioned. Wait, actually, checking the list, I see a waypoint named ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" No, wait, the user wrote ""Formula Electric Mech Bay,"" but in our data, it's just listed as ""Formula Electric."" So maybe that's confusing.

2. **Baja**: There is a waypoint called ""Baja"" with keywords including ""baja"" and others. That should be fine.

3. **Rocketry**: Scanning through the waypoints, I don't see any mention of ""Rocketry"" or related terms. Our list includes things like ""Concrete Canoe,"" ""Formula Electric,"" etc., but not Rocketry.

4. **Midnight Sun**: Again, checking the provided waypoints, there's no entry for ""Midnight Sun."" It doesn't appear anywhere in the list.

Next, looking at the structure: The user wrote ""the to"" which seems like a typo. It should probably be ""then to,"" but regardless, it might not affect the parsing too much.

Now, applying the rules. For each waypoint mentioned, we need to check if after ignoring extra tokens, the remaining text includes any of the keywords or the waypoint's name words.

- **Formula Electric Mech Bay**: The user is asking for a waypoint that isn't listed as such. Our waypoints include ""Formula Electric"" but not ""Mech Bay."" So this might be invalid.
  
- **Baja**: This is valid because there's a waypoint named Baja with matching keywords.

- **Rocketry**: No matching waypoint found, so it's invalid.

- **Midnight Sun**: Again, no such waypoint exists, so invalid.

Since three out of four waypoints are invalid or ambiguous, the command can't be processed as given. The user might have made a typo or referred to non-existent locations.

The response should inform them that some waypoints don't exist and provide an error message.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so the user asked, ""What is the best team if I like robots?"" I need to figure out how to respond based on the given waypoints and rules. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I should understand what the user is asking. They're looking for a team recommendation because they like robots. Now, looking at the available waypoints, I need to check if any of them relate to robotics or teams that work with robots.

The waypoints provided include places like E7 - Ideas Clinic, C&D - Coffee Area, and RoboHub Entrance. The RoboHub seems relevant here since it likely has a team related to robotics. Let me confirm the keywords for each waypoint.

For example, RoboHub's keywords might be ""robo"" or ""hub,"" which are directly related to robots. Since the user mentioned liking robots, this seems like the best fit. I don't see any other waypoints that clearly relate to a robotics team.

I should check if there are any other possible matches. The E7 - Ideas Clinic and C&D areas don't seem to be about robotics. So, RoboHub is the clear choice here.

Next, according to the rules, after determining the waypoint, I need to construct an action. Since the user asked for a recommendation, speaking the response makes sense. I should phrase it in a helpful way, suggesting they visit the RoboHub to join the team.

I also need to make sure that my response follows the format specified, using ""speak"" as the action and providing the appropriate message. There's no need for navigation here since the user isn't asking to go anywhere; they're just seeking information.

So, I'll structure the response with a single speak action advising them on which team to join based on their interest in robots.
</think>

To determine if the user's query matches any available waypoint, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Query**: The user is asking for a recommendation about the ""best team"" they can join if they like robots.

2. **Matching Keywords**:
   - Looking at all available waypoints and their associated keywords, none of them explicitly mention ""robots"" or directly relate to a robotics-related team.
   - Waypoints like ""C&D - Coffee Area"" and ""RoboHub Entrance"" might be related to technology or robotics, but they don't have keywords that match the user's query about joining a robotics team.

3. **Conclusion**: Since there are no waypoints explicitly tied to a robotics team or matching the user's interest in robots, the request is considered invalid.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's question. The user asked, ""Do you know where the machine shop instructor room is?"" 

First, I need to understand what they're asking for. They seem to be looking for a specific location: the machine shop instructor's room. So, my task is to determine if such a waypoint exists based on the given keywords.

Looking at the list of waypoints provided, each has a set of keywords associated with it. I'll go through each waypoint one by one to see if any match the query.

1. **Starting Location**: Not relevant here since the user isn't starting yet.
2. **Waypoints**:
   - **Role**: Keywords include ""role"". The query doesn't mention anything related, so probably not a match.
   - **Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching**: These are rules, not a physical location, so no.
   - **Handling Complex Commands**: Again, these are guidelines, not a place.
   - **Supported Edge Cases**: Same as above; not a physical location.

Continuing through the list:
- **Waypoints like ""Navigate"", ""speak"", and ""wait""** are functions, not locations.
- Other waypoints listed (like ""C&D - Coffee Area"", ""RoboHub Entrance"") don't have keywords that match ""machine shop"" or ""instructor room"".

The user's query includes the terms ""machine shop"" and ""instructor room"". I check all the waypoints' names and their associated keywords. None of them include either of these phrases or related terms.

Since none of the waypoints match the keywords from the user's question, it means the waypoint doesn't exist in the provided data. Therefore, according to the rules, I should respond by saying that the waypoint doesn't exist.

Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. Let me read it carefully: ""Go to the Formula Electric Electrical bay, then the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja.""

First, I'll break down each part of the command step by step.

Starting with the first destination: ""Formula Electric Electrical bay."" Looking at the waypoints provided, there's an ""Electrical Bay"" under Formula Electric. The keywords for this waypoint include ""formula electric,"" ""electrical,"" and ""bay."" So when the user says ""Formula Electric Electrical bay,"" that matches because it includes ""formula electric"" and ""electrical.""

Next is ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" From the waypoints, there's a ""Mechanical Bay"" under Formula Electric with keywords including ""formula electric,"" ""mech,"" and ""bay."" The user's mention of ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" fits as it contains both ""formula electric"" and ""mech.""

Then the user says ""then the Baja."" There's a waypoint called ""Baja"" with keywords like ""baja,"" ""off-road,"" etc. So this clearly points to that specific waypoint.

After that, the user mentions ""Midnight Sun."" Hmm, I don't see any waypoints named ""Midnight Sun"" in the provided list. The closest might be something related to lighting or another area, but since it's not listed, I can't match this part of the command.

The next instruction is to wait 5 minutes after reaching Midnight Sun. Since Midnight Sun isn't a valid waypoint, any subsequent actions depending on it become invalid too.

Finally, the user wants to go back to Baja after waiting. But since we couldn't reach Midnight Sun, we can't execute this last part either.

So, breaking it down: The first three destinations are valid and can be navigated to. The fourth destination is invalid, so any actions after that (waiting and returning) can't be executed. I need to respond by handling each valid step but stopping when the invalid command is encountered.

I should structure the response with navigate actions for each of the first three waypoints, then address the invalid Midnight Sun request. Since waiting and returning are after an invalid action, they won't be included because the process stops at the first error.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: ""Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll check if there's a waypoint named ""Silent Study"" in the provided list. Looking through all the waypoints:

- The available waypoints include places like E7 Ideas Clinic, C&D Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic, and others, but I don't see any mention of ""Silent Study."" 

Next, I'll consider if there's a keyword match. Each waypoint has specific keywords associated with it. For example, the E7 Ideas Clinic has keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], so if the user mentions anything related to those words, it would match.

In this case, the user mentioned ""Silent Study."" I need to see if any of the existing waypoints have keywords that include terms like ""study"" or something similar. Looking at all the waypoints, none seem to have ""study"" as part of their keywords. 

Additionally, I should check for any extra tokens the user might have included, but in this case, ""Silent Study"" doesn't have any alphanumeric prefixes or other codes attached. So, there's no need to ignore any tokens here.

Since there's no matching waypoint for ""Silent Study,"" the system should respond by indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the rules provided, if none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, I need to output an error message saying, ""This waypoint does not exist.""

I don't see any other actions required beyond this because the command is straightforward—navigate and wait. But since the destination doesn't exist, there's no point in proceeding further.

So, the response should be a single speak action informing the user that their requested waypoint isn't valid.

{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's command ""Go to UWAFT's workbay."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the available waypoints provided. There's a waypoint named ""UWAFT - Workbay"" with coordinates (100, 200) and keywords like [""workbay"", ""area""]. 

The user's command starts with ""Go to UWAFT's workbay."" According to the rules, I should ignore any extra tokens before the main identifier. In this case, ""UWAFT's"" is part of the waypoint name, so it's not an extra token but part of the identifier.

Next, I need to check if the cleaned input matches any keywords or the waypoint's name. The cleaned command after ignoring extra tokens would be ""workbay."" 

Looking at the waypoint ""UWAFT - Workbay,"" its keywords include ""workbay"" and ""area."" Since ""workbay"" is part of both the cleaned command and the waypoint's keywords, this should match.

I also need to ensure that no other waypoints have overlapping keywords. Scanning through the list, none of the other waypoints like ""UW Cleanroom"" or ""ideas clinic"" have ""workbay"" in their names or keywords. So, it's a clear match.

Therefore, the action is to navigate to ""UWAFT - Workbay."" I'll structure the response with a single navigate action pointing to that waypoint.
</think>

```json

  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Looking at the list of available waypoints provided earlier, I need to check if there's a waypoint named ""Elevators"" or something similar. From the data given, I see various waypoints like ""Starting Location,"" but none are explicitly named ""Elevators."" 

The user also mentioned using keyword matching rules. So, I should consider whether any of the available waypoints have keywords related to elevators. However, in the provided list, there's no waypoint with ""elevator"" or ""elevators"" as part of its name or keywords. The closest might be something like ""ideas clinic,"" but that doesn't apply here.

Since ""Elevators"" isn't listed as a valid waypoint and none of the existing waypoints have related keywords, I can't find a matching waypoint. According to the rules, if no waypoint matches, I should respond with an error message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

I also need to make sure I'm following all the instructions correctly. The robot is supposed to process commands sequentially and handle errors appropriately. In this case, since ""Elevators"" isn't a valid waypoint, any attempt to navigate there would fail.

So, the appropriate response is to output a speak action informing the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want to be taken to the ""Formula Electric Waterloop design team."" Hmm, first I need to figure out which waypoint this corresponds to.

Looking at the list of waypoints provided, I see entries like ""Concrete Canoe"" and others with keywords including ""design team."" Wait, there's a waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords that include ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team."" So, if someone mentions the design team without specifying which project they're referring to, it might default to this one.

Another possibility is checking for any waypoints specifically related to electric waterloop. But looking through the list, I don't see any waypoints with those exact keywords. The closest match seems to be ""Concrete Canoe"" because of the ""design team"" part in its keywords.

So, after ignoring any extra tokens and focusing on the core terms, the only matching waypoint is ""Concrete Canoe."" Even though it's not exactly Formula Electric or Waterloop, it's the only one with the design team reference. Therefore, I should navigate to that location.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user command: ""Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and wait 15 seconds."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, the starting point is that the robot begins at (0.0, 0.0). The user's instruction has two parts: navigating to a specific location and then waiting for 15 seconds there.

Looking at the first part, ""navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area."" I remember from the guidelines that extra tokens before the core name should be ignored. So if the waypoint is named something like ""C&D - Coffee Area"" but the user says ""C&D - Hot Food Area,"" I need to check if this matches any existing waypoints.

Wait, in the provided waypoints, I don't see a ""C&D - Hot Food Area."" The closest one mentioned is ""C&D - Coffee Area"" as an example in the understanding section. But in the actual waypoint list given by the user, there's no entry for C&D areas except perhaps the starting location. Hmm, maybe I misread.

Looking back at the waypoints listed, I don't see any that match ""C&D - Hot Food Area."" The only mention of C&D is in an example, not in the actual data provided. So when the user refers to this area, it doesn't exist in the available waypoints.

So according to rule 4, if none of the waypoints meet the keyword criteria, I should output that the waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, the command also includes a ""wait"" action after navigating. Since the navigation part is invalid, the entire command becomes invalid because you can't navigate to a non-existent location.

Therefore, the response should be an error message stating that the waypoint doesn't exist.
</think>

The user's instruction attempts to navigate to a waypoint that doesn't exist in the provided data. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Command Analysis:** The command is to navigate to ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" and wait 15 seconds.
2. **Waypoint Check:** There's no waypoint named ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" in the given list.
3. **Response:** Since the waypoint doesn't exist, an error message is returned.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,[],,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this user query. The user is asking me to go through a series of waypoints and perform actions in sequence.

First, I need to parse each part of the command: ""Go to Formula Electric Electrical bay"", but from the waypoint list, I don't see an electrical bay for Formula Electric. However, there's a Mech Bay mentioned as ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"". So maybe the user made a typo or is referring to another name.

Next, after the Mech Bay, they want me to go to Baja, then Rocketry, Midnight Sun, wait 5 minutes, and back to Baja. Let me check each waypoint:

- Formula Electric Mech Bay: Yes, that's listed with keywords like ""formula"", ""electric"", ""mech"".
- Baja: I don't see a waypoint named ""Baja"" in the list provided.
- Rocketry: There is a waypoint called Rocketry with keywords including ""rocketry"", so that should be fine.

Midnight Sun isn't mentioned anywhere, so it's invalid. Also, since Baja doesn't exist, I can't proceed beyond that point.

So, the first valid waypoint after Formula Electric Mech Bay would be Rocketry. Since Baja and Midnight Sun aren't present, I'll process up to Rocketry and then inform the user about the missing waypoints.
