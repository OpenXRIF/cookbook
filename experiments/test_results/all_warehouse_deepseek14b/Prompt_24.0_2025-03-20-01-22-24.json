The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt ID": 24.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Take me to each kind of M6 bolt.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The user is asking, \"Take me to each kind of M6 bolt.\" Hmm, so they want to visit all the containers that have different types of M6 bolts.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which containers are relevant. From the given data, there are several containers in section A with M6 bolts of varying lengths and specifications. Each container has a unique code like A-01-001, A-02-002, etc., along with specific bolt details.\n\nI need to parse the user's request carefully. They mentioned \"each kind\" which implies they want to visit every container that holds a different M6 bolt. So I should list all these containers and plan a path that covers each one.\n\nBut wait, the system can only perform a limited number of actions based on navigate, speak, and wait. The response should be a series of actions starting from the current location, moving to each container in sequence, then returning to the starting point.\n\nI should ensure that after visiting all containers, the robot navigates back to the starting point (0,0). Also, between each move, there's no need for waiting unless specified. \n\nHowever, looking at the examples provided, when the user asks to go to multiple places, the response is a list of navigate actions followed by speak and then returning. But in this case, since it's \"each kind,\" maybe I should confirm if they want me to visit each one or just inform them about their locations.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify whether they need to collect items or just know where they are. Since the response examples include navigating to a container and then back, perhaps I should assume they want to go through each container sequentially.\n\nSo, I'll list all the M6 containers, create navigate actions for each in order, add a speak action after each visit, and finally return to the starting point.\n\nBut wait again, how many containers are there? Let's check the given data. There are four M6-related containers:\n\n1. A-01-001: M6 bolts\n2. A-02-002: M6 x 1.0mm bolts\n3. A-03-003: M6 locknuts\n4. A-04-004: M6-1.0x55mm bolts\n\nSo, four containers in total. Each should be visited one after another.\n\nBut in the example responses, sometimes only one navigate action is included. So maybe I need to structure it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects a single response that includes all necessary steps.\n\nWait, no. The system's examples show that each action is processed sequentially. So if there are four containers, the actions would be four navigate commands, followed by speaks, and then return home.\n\nBut in this case, since the user said \"each kind,\" maybe I should inform them about each container's location instead of physically moving to each one. However, the examples show that when a specific container is requested, it navigates there.\n\nI think the correct approach here is to navigate sequentially to each M6-related container. But considering the system's limitations and examples, perhaps it's better to take the user through all containers step by step, but the example responses only show moving to one location at a time.\n\nWait, no, in the first example, \"grab some windshield wiper fluid,\" they go to C-06-161. Then another example with A1-05. So perhaps for each container, it's a separate action.\n\nBut how can I represent visiting multiple containers in one query? The user is asking to take them to each kind of M6 bolt, so that implies visiting all applicable containers.\n\nHowever, the system might not support multi-step navigation without additional instructions. So perhaps the correct response is to list all the containers and their locations, as per the example where it answers with a speak action about the container's location.\n\nIn the fourth example, when asked about Milwaukee Power Drill, it responds by speaking the container's name. So maybe in this case, I should do the same: tell the user that there are multiple M6 bolt containers and provide their locations.\n\nBut the user specifically said \"Take me to each kind,\" which implies they want to move physically to each location. However, since the system can only perform navigate actions one at a time, perhaps it's not feasible to go through all in a single response without additional processing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user is asking for each kind of M6 bolt, which are in specific containers with unique codes. So I should identify all these containers and include navigate actions for each, followed by speak actions acknowledging the visit, then returning home.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n1. Navigate to A-01-001, speak about M6 bolts.\n2. Then navigate to A-02-002, speak about M6 x 1.0mm.\n3. Next, go to A-03-003 for locknuts.\n4. After that, proceed to A-04-004 for the 55mm bolts.\n5. Finally, return home.\n\nBut in the examples, only one navigate action is included per response. So perhaps I should handle this as multiple separate actions or inform the user about each container's location instead.\n\nWait, but the system can process multiple actions in a single response. Looking at the example where the user asks to go through several steps (like picking up items), the assistant includes all necessary navigate and speak actions in one go.\n\nSo yes, I think it's acceptable to include all four containers' navigation commands, each followed by a speak action, then return home.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's request of visiting each container with M6 bolts, we will structure the response to sequentially navigate through each relevant container. Each visit is followed by a brief acknowledgment, and finally, we return to the starting point.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Navigate to A-01-001**: Move from (0,0) to (Aisle A, Section 01).\n   - **Speak**: \"Arrived at A-01-001, home of standard M6 bolts.\"\n2. **Navigate to A-02-002**: Proceed to the next section in Aisle A.\n   - **Speak**: \"Reached A-02-002, featuring M6 x 1.0mm bolts.\"\n3. **Navigate to A-03-003**: Move further along Aisle A for locknuts.\n   - **Speak**: \"Now at A-03-003, home of M6 locknuts.\"\n4. **Navigate to A-04-004**: Continue to the final section in Aisle A.\n   - **Speak**: \"Arrived at A-04-004, offering M6-1.0x55mm bolts.\"\n5. **Return Home**: Navigate back to (0,0) after completing all visits.\n\nThis sequence ensures each container is visited in order, providing the user with the locations and types of M6 bolts available.",
