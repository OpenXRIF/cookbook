The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"Can you tell Max over by the boots to stop eating my lunch?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. The input is: \"Can you tell Max over by the boots to stop eating my lunch?\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the command. The user is asking the system (presumably a robot or AI) to communicate with someone named Max. They want Max to stop eating their lunch, and they're specifying that Max is near the boots.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, I should check if this request fits into any supported actions. The system can only execute navigate, speak, or wait actions. There's no function for sending messages to other people or giving commands to them beyond its own capabilities.\n\nThe user's command includes a person (\"Max\") and an instruction (\"stop eating my lunch\"). Since the system isn't designed to relay messages between people, it doesn't have the capability to tell Max to do something. It can only perform actions on its own, like moving or speaking.\n\nI should also consider if any part of this request relates to navigating or retrieving items, but in this case, it's about interacting with another person, which isn't supported.\n\nTherefore, since the system can't process commands involving other people, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. However, in this case, it's more about an unsupported action rather than a non-existent waypoint. But according to the rules, if the request doesn't match any available waypoints and involves functions beyond navigate, speak, or wait, I should output an error.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, there are no waypoints involved. The user is asking to interact with another person, Max. So it's not a matter of a missing waypoint but an unsupported action type.\n\nLooking back at the rules: \"Unsupported Actions\" section says if the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output that message.\n\nBut in this case, the system isn't being asked to perform an action beyond those; rather, it's being asked to interact with another person. Since there's no predefined way for the system to communicate with others beyond its own actions, I think the appropriate response is to say that the waypoint doesn't exist because the context (telling Max) isn't tied to any container or item.\n\nAlternatively, since the command involves a person and not a container, it might be considered an invalid waypoint reference. So, the system would output that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention a container code. They just mentioned \"over by the boots.\" Maybe they're referring to a location near the boots, which could be a container or area. But in the given data, all waypoints are specific containers with codes and coordinates. So if \"the boots\" isn't a defined waypoint, then it's invalid.\n\nBut the user is trying to tell Max, not go to a container. So perhaps the system should respond that it can't comply because it's an unsupported action.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"Unsupported Actions: If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output...\" So in this case, the command is to send a message to Max, which isn't one of the supported actions. Therefore, the system should respond with \"Unsupported action requested.\"\n\nBut looking at the examples, when the user asked for something that didn't exist, it responded with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" In this case, since the request involves an unsupported function (telling another person), I think it's more appropriate to say \"Unsupported action requested.\"\n\nWait, but in the initial query, the user is asking the system to tell Max. So the system isn't directly performing any action beyond its capabilities except that it can speak, but only to itself or provide information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to clarify: if the command includes functions beyond navigate, speak, or wait, then it's unsupported. Telling another person would require a message function, which is beyond those.\n\nBut in this case, the user is asking the system to communicate with Max, but since the system can't do that, maybe the response should be \"This waypoint does not exist\" if they're referring to a non-existent container near boots, or \"Unsupported action requested\" because it's trying to perform an unsupported function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system doesn't recognize any containers related to \"boots,\" so it would output the invalid waypoint message. But since \"boots\" isn't part of any container code, and there's no such waypoint, it's more likely that the system should respond with the invalid waypoint error.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify a container, just mentioned boots as a location. So maybe it's ambiguous. However, without a specific container code, the system can't navigate to an area based on proximity to boots unless there's a defined waypoint for that.\n\nGiven all this, I think the appropriate response is to output \"This waypoint does not exist\" because the system doesn't recognize a container related to boots or Max.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"text\": \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
