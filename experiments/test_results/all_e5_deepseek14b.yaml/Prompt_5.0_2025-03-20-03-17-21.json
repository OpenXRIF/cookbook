Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n*Below is the users query to respond to*\n\"Take me to the Forumla Electric WARG design team.\"",

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the Forumla Electric WARG design team.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user request: \"Take me to the Formula Electric WARG design team.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the request. The user wants to navigate to a specific location. The key part is identifying which waypoint they're referring to.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints provided, there are several that mention \"Design Team\" or similar terms. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords include \"formula electric\", \"lab\". The user mentioned \"Formula Electric\", so this could be relevant.\n2. **Concrete Canoe**: Keywords include \"concrete\", \"canoe\". Doesn't seem related to the request.\n3. **Electric WARG Design Team**: Wait, no, looking back, I don't see an entry for that exact name. Hmm.\n4. **Waypoints with \"Design Team\"**: Let me check each one:\n   - Concrete Canoe: Has \"design team\" as keywords.\n   - Formula Electric (FE) Lab: Keywords are \"formula electric\", \"lab\". Not directly mentioning design team, but maybe it's implied.\n   - There might be others, but from the list provided, only a few have \"design team\" in their keywords.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the waypoints again, I see:\n\n- **Concrete Canoe** has keywords including \"concrete\", \"canoe\", and \"design team\".\n- **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords are \"formula electric\", \"lab\".\n\nThe user's request is for \"Formula Electric WARG design team.\" Let's process this according to the rules. \n\nStep 1: Ignore extra tokens if any, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The cleaned input is \"Forumla Electric WARG design team.\" (Note: There might be a typo here; the user wrote \"Forumla\" instead of \"Formula\".)\n\nStep 2: Keyword matching. For each waypoint, check if the cleaned input includes at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name.\n\nLooking for \"formula electric\", \"design team\", etc. \n\n- The **Electric WARG Design Team** isn't listed as a separate waypoint in the provided data. Wait, checking again, I don't see that exact name. Maybe it's under another name?\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have missed something. Let me check each waypoint:\n\n1. Formula Electric (FE) Lab: Keywords are [\"formula electric\", \"lab\"].\n2. Concrete Canoe: Keywords include [\"concrete\", \"canoe\", \"design team\"].\n\nThe user's request includes \"Formula Electric\" and \"Design Team\". The closest match would be the **Concrete Canoe** because it has \"design team\" as a keyword, but that doesn't mention Formula Electric.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe there's a waypoint named something like \"Electric WARG Design Team\" that I didn't list here. But according to the provided data, the only waypoints with \"design team\" are Concrete Canoe and possibly others, but not Formula Electric related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant \"Formula Electric\" without the design team part. In that case, the waypoint would be **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**.\n\nBut since the user specifically mentioned both \"Formula Electric\" and \"Design Team\", I need to see if any waypoint combines both terms or has related keywords.\n\nWait, reviewing the waypoints again:\n\n- **Concrete Canoe**: Keywords are [\"concrete\", \"canoe\", \"design team\"].\n- **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords are [\"formula electric\", \"lab\"].\n\nNo other waypoints have both \"formula electric\" and \"design team\". So if I process the user's request, after ignoring extra tokens, it's \"formula electric warg design team.\" \n\nNow, let's check each waypoint:\n\n- For **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: The cleaned input includes \"formula electric\", which is a keyword for this waypoint. So it's a match.\n- For **Concrete Canoe**: The keywords include \"design team\", but the user also mentioned \"formula electric\", which isn't part of this waypoint's name or keywords.\n\nTherefore, the request matches **Formula Electric (FE) Lab** because it includes \"formula electric\" as a keyword. The mention of \"WARG design team\" might be extra tokens, but since the primary match is based on \"formula electric\", that's sufficient according to rule 1 and 2.\n\nSo, I should navigate to **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the user request, we need to identify the correct waypoint using keyword matching. The user wants to go to \"Formula Electric WARG design team.\" \n\n- After ignoring extra tokens, the cleaned input is \"formula electric warg design team.\"\n- Checking each waypoint:\n  - **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**: Keywords include \"formula electric,\" which matches part of the request.\n  - No other waypoints have both \"formula electric\" and \"design team.\"\n\nThus, the correct match is **Formula Electric (FE) Lab**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"intent\": \"navigate_to_lab\",\n  \"response\": {\n    \"waypoint\": \"Formula Electric (FE) Lab\"\n  }\n}\n```",
