Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user's request. The user wrote: \"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of the command step by step.\n\nStarting with the first instruction: \"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay.\" Looking at the waypoints provided, there's a waypoint named \"Formula Electric - Mech Bay\" with keywords like \"formula electric\", \"mech bay\". The user mentioned \"Formula Electric Mech Bay,\" so after ignoring extra tokens, it should match this waypoint. So that's clear.\n\nNext, \"then the Baja.\" The waypoint for Baja is listed as \"Baja\" with keywords including \"baja\". So that seems straightforward.\n\nThen, \"the to Rocketry.\" Hmm, there's a typo here\u2014it should probably be \"to Rocketry.\" The waypoint is \"Rocketry\" with keywords like \"rocketry\". So that should match without issues.\n\nAfter that, the user says \"then to Midnight Sun.\" Now, looking at all the provided waypoints, I don't see one named \"Midnight Sun.\" The available ones include Baja, C&D - Coffee Area, Formula Electric - Mech Bay, Rocketry, and others, but not Midnight Sun. So this part is problematic because it's an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo, when processing each step, the first three are valid waypoints, but the fourth one isn't recognized. According to the rules, if any part of the command refers to a non-existent waypoint, the entire action should be considered invalid. But wait, in this case, maybe I can process up to the valid steps before the error occurs.\n\nBut looking at the examples provided, when an unknown zone is encountered early on, it returns an error message. However, here, the first three waypoints are valid, but the fourth isn't. So perhaps I should handle each part individually and stop at the first invalid waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to say \"Midnight Sun\" as a known waypoint that's not listed. But since it's not in the provided data, it's invalid. Therefore, when processing each step sequentially, upon reaching the fourth instruction (to Midnight Sun), I should output an error message.\n\nBut wait, let me check the exact rules. The user's command is to go through multiple waypoints and then perform actions after arriving at Midnight Sun. Since the first three are valid, but the fourth isn't, the system should process each step in order until it hits the invalid one.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire action is considered invalid, or does each step have to be valid? The rules say that if after ignoring extra tokens, the input doesn't match any available waypoints, it's invalid. So perhaps each navigation step needs to be a valid waypoint.\n\nTherefore, when processing \"go to Midnight Sun,\" since it's invalid, the entire command is invalid. Alternatively, maybe only that specific instruction is invalid, but I'm not sure if partial execution is allowed.\n\nLooking at the examples given, in one case where an unknown zone is mentioned, the response was a single speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist. So perhaps if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire command is considered invalid, and the system should respond with that error message without processing further steps.\n\nBut let me think again. The user's instruction includes multiple waypoints: Formula Electric Mech Bay, Baja, Rocketry, Midnight Sun, then wait 5 minutes, back to Baja. So perhaps I need to process each waypoint one by one and only stop when an invalid one is encountered.\n\nSo first, navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay\u2014valid. Then, from there, go to Baja\u2014valid. Next, go to Rocketry\u2014valid. Then, go to Midnight Sun\u2014which is invalid. So at this point, I should output the error message because that step isn't valid. The subsequent instructions (waiting and returning) depend on successfully reaching Midnight Sun, which didn't happen.\n\nTherefore, the system should process up to Rocketry but stop there when it encounters Midnight Sun as invalid, then return an error. Alternatively, since the first four steps include a non-existent waypoint, maybe the entire command is considered invalid from the start.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user's instruction has multiple waypoints, each needing to be valid. So perhaps all of them need to be valid for the command to proceed. If any step is invalid, the whole command is invalid, and an error message is given.\n\nIn this case, since Midnight Sun isn't a valid waypoint, the entire command is invalid, so the response should be that the waypoint doesn't exist. But looking at the examples again, when part of the command was invalid (like unknown zone), it returned an error without processing further steps.\n\nWait, in the example where the user said \"go to unknown zone,\" the system responded immediately with an error message, not trying to process any subsequent valid waypoints. So perhaps the same applies here\u2014if any step refers to a non-existent waypoint, the entire command is invalid, and only an error message is returned.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The initial steps might be valid, but since one of them isn't, should I return an error or just process as much as possible?\n\nI think according to the rules, if any part of the command refers to a non-existent waypoint, it's invalid. So in this case, the response would be that Midnight Sun doesn't exist.\n\nBut let me check: The user is asking to go through multiple steps, but one of them is invalid. So should I process each step sequentially and return an error when hitting the first invalid one? Or treat the entire command as invalid if any part is wrong?\n\nIn the given example with \"unknown zone,\" it seems like the system returns an error without processing further steps. Therefore, in this case, when reaching Midnight Sun, which isn't valid, I should output that error.\n\nHowever, perhaps a better approach is to check all waypoints first before executing any actions. But the user's command includes multiple sequential steps, so each step depends on the previous one being successful.\n\nTherefore, upon attempting to navigate to Midnight Sun after successfully navigating to Rocketry, it would fail and return an error message. So the system should process the valid steps up until that point but then stop and inform the user about the invalid waypoint.\n\nWait, but according to the rules provided, when a waypoint doesn't exist, the command is invalid, so perhaps the entire command is considered invalid, regardless of prior valid steps.\n\nI think it's safer to assume that if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the whole command is invalid. Therefore, the system should return an error message indicating that Midnight Sun isn't a valid waypoint.\n\nThus, the response would be: \"The waypoint 'Midnight Sun' does not exist.\" without processing further steps.\n</think>\n\nThe user's command includes navigating to multiple waypoints, but one of them (\"Midnight Sun\") is invalid.
