    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: \"Robot, go to [[Silent Study]], say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice, and wait for 15 minutes.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, there's nothing named \"[[Silent Study]]\". That means the robot can't find a waypoint that matches this part of the command. So, it might not be able to navigate or speak as needed.\n\nThe user is instructing the robot to go to an unknown place and wait for 15 minutes. Since there's no predefined way to \"say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice,\" the robot probably can't perform that action either. It doesn't have a speech function beyond what's already been set, which might be default speak.\n\nI should consider whether any of the known waypoints need to be prioritized or if they could be used creatively. But without \"[[Silent Study]]\", the only functions I can use are navigate and wait, unless there's an unknown action required. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for \"say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice,\" which isn't part of any known waypoint. So, it seems like the robot can't fulfill that request because there's no waypoint named \"[[Silent Study]]\" and no predefined speech function to say that phrase.\n\nTherefore, the response should recognize this as an invalid or ambiguous command and output a speak action with an error message.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: '[[Silent Study]]' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
