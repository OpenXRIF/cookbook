    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this task. The user provided a detailed prompt about navigating through various zones in RoboHub with specific waypoints. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The goal is to generate a series of actions that guide the robot from one location to another, stopping at each specified waypoint for tasks like picking up or dropping off packages. Each action should be in the order they're mentioned in the prompt: start at C&D - Hot Food Area, collect a prepared order, move to RoboHub, and so on.\n\nI notice that the user has provided an example with multiple waypoints. They want the robot to navigate through each zone, stopping at each one for specific tasks. I need to make sure my solution follows this structure exactly.\n\nThe user's prompt also includes handling complex commands by processing them in a left-to-right sequence and avoiding ambiguity. So, if there are any conflicting instructions, I should choose the most logical way to interpret them without getting stuck.\n\nLooking at the examples given, it seems that each action is straightforward: navigate, speak, or wait. The robot needs to be aware of its current location, move along specific paths, pick up items, drop off packages, and return to areas as needed.\n\nI should start by identifying all the waypoints mentioned in the prompt. From the example provided, the relevant zones are C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Hot Food Area, C&D - Hot Lunch Area, C&D - Hot Food Area again (but that's redundant), RoboHub, and Ideas Clinic.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial description, there's a list of waypoints for each zone. For example, C&D - Coffee Area has several zones like Coffee Attendant, Coffee Assistant, etc., each with their own coordinates. Similarly, for Hot Food Area, there are different tasks or areas they need to reach.\n\nSo, the robot needs to start at C&D - Hot Food Area and navigate towards specific areas in that zone before moving on to RoboHub.\n\nI think I should create a list of waypoints as per the prompt, ensuring each one is correctly identified. Then, for each step, outline the action: navigate to the next waypoint, collect or drop off items, etc., with the necessary input parameters like name and coordinates.\n\nAlso, considering the normalized steps: first normalize both user input and known names by lowercasing them. That should make comparisons easier since \"Coffee Area\" and \"coffee area\" are treated identically.\n\nExtraneous tokens\u2014any token that starts a building code or seems non-essential could be removed. For example, if a token like \"Building Code\" appears at the beginning of the input, it's discarded because it's not an essential identifier for location.\n\nTokenization is straightforward: split both the user's input and each known waypoint into individual words. Similar to what was mentioned earlier in the role description.\n\nFor similarity calculation, we check if every token from the waypoint name exists in the user's input or that a high percentage (80% or more) are present. This allows for including additional tokens without affecting the match, which is crucial since users might provide extra information but still have a valid route.\n\nIf a single waypoint matches, it's selected as the action. If multiple match, the highest similarity score determines the action. However, if no known waypoint matches, an \"action\" with \"speak\" and the message should be returned.\n\nAlso, if any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is requested, we return a list with only that \"speak\" action, mentioning it's unsupported.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps. Now, I'll structure my response to follow each of these points precisely, ensuring the robot can navigate through all specified zones correctly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"You are the robot.
