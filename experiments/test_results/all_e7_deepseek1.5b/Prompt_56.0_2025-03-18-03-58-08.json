    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down how I approached this problem. The user provided a detailed prompt about handling advanced fuzzy matching for waypoints and supported edge cases. They also gave an example of a request that required navigating to specific locations and using certain functions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task at hand. The user wants me to process a given query or command, identify if there are any unknown waypoints involved, handle complex commands with left-to-right processing, select the best action sequence based on similarity scores, and return appropriate actions or error messages for unsupported functions.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, they wanted to take someone to an unknown zone. So, I realized that my system should detect if a waypoint is invalid and respond accordingly. If the query isn't in the known list of waypoints, it returns a speak action with an error message stating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also considered edge cases. For instance, if the command includes multiple steps or ambiguous interpretations, the system should prioritize the most straightforward interpretation. In this case, since the unknown zone wasn't recognized, it handled it by defaulting to a speak action.\n\nLooking at the user's query \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\", I saw that 'E7 silent study' isn't in the waypoint list provided. Therefore, my system would identify it as invalid and respond with the appropriate error message.\n\nI also made sure to structure the response correctly, following all specified steps like normalization, tokenization, similarity calculation, selection, and fallback. This ensures that the system can handle a variety of commands efficiently, even when some waypoints are unknown or ambiguous.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7 silent study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
