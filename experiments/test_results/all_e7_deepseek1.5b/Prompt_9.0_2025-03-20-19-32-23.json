For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. They said, \"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\" Hmm, okay. So they want me to navigate from the current location back to the Ideas Clinic.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints and their locations might help. The current point is the Assembly Room, which is located at (1865, 434). The Ideas Clinic's coordinates are (25,75). \n\nI remember that when matching waypoint names, I need to check if each known waypoint matches by having most of its tokens present in the input. The current location has \"Assembly Room,\" which is a known waypoint with an unknown coordinate since it was only placed recently. But wait, in this case, the user didn't mention moving yet. So maybe they're at the same coordinates as before? Or perhaps I should consider that the user might have moved elsewhere.\n\nBut looking back, in the examples, when navigating from one place to another, we just navigate directly. The key is to use the waypoint named after where you need to go. Since the user wants to return to Ideas Clinic from the Assembly Room, and \"ideas clinic\" isn't a known waypoint, maybe I should explain that they can't do it yet.\n\nSo, I think in this case, since the user mentioned going back to Ideas Clinic, but there's no waypoint named \"Ideas Clinic,\" I should acknowledge that and offer help. That makes sense because they need to know where to go next, but they don't have a direct command for it yet.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"We're at the Assembly Room now.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Ideas Clinic is next, but we don't have a direct command for it yet.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
