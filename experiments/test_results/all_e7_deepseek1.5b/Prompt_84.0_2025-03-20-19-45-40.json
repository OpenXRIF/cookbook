For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user has given me this prompt about navigating to specific waypoints on a map. They want me to figure out the actions needed based on that. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the query means. The query is \"Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes.\" So, there are three main parts: moving with a robot, going to a specific zone, and waiting.\n\nI remember from the problem statement that when matching waypoints, I have to consider normalization, tokenization, similarity, and selection. Also, if the query mentions commands like navigate or speak, they take priority unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet me look at the available waypoint names. There are several like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"Robot, proceed...wait,\" which includes a command inside, but I think that's part of the action. Wait, actually, no. The waypoint name is just \"C&D - Main Entrance\" because it includes a command in the name.\n\nHmm, so when I look up \"C&D - Main Entrance\" in the available list, does that mean the exact waypoint exists? Let me check the known waypoints. Yes, \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is listed as waypoint 0 with coordinates (0,0). So that's straightforward\u2014navigate to C&D Main Entrance.\n\nNow, for the waiting part: the user said wait for 10 minutes. The available functions include speak and wait. But in the problem statement, it says if a function isn't supported beyond navigate, speak is used instead of waiting. So I think here, they want to use \"speak\" because it's not a supported action.\n\nPutting it together: the user wants to navigate to C&D Main Entrance and then say wait for 10 minutes. The first action is navigate to that spot. Then, after finishing, they need to speak to command the robot to wait. But wait, does the speak action in this context allow them to tell the robot to pause or wait? In the example earlier, they used \"speak\" with an input like \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\" So it's about giving a message.\n\nSo after navigating, I'll have two actions: first, navigate to C&D Main Entrance. Second, give a command to speak and tell the robot to wait for 10 minutes. But wait, is there an action for waiting? The problem says \"speak\" can be used if it's not supported. So I need to structure that.\n\nWait, but in the query, after moving, they want to wait for 10 minutes. In the example, when they asked for keys, they gave a message. So maybe it's just telling them to stop moving. Or is there an action for waiting? Looking back at the problem statement: if you can't specify \"wait,\" use \"speak\" instead.\n\nSo, I think after navigating, the next step is to give a command that tells the robot to wait. Since the speak function allows me to do that by giving a message, maybe it's just another command. But looking at how commands are handled in the examples, they used a specific input with \"speak\" and an action.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem statement says that if you can't specify \"navigate,\" etc., you use \"speak.\" So for waiting, perhaps I need to use \"speak\" again? Or maybe not. Let me check the available functions: navigate, speak, wait. So \"navigate\" is in the list. But for waiting, it's not listed as a function.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait isn't a function; it's more of an action within the command sequence. Hmm. The problem statement says that if any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return the speak action with error. So maybe I have to use \"speak\" for waiting as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps wait isn't a function but part of the input when you want to stop moving. Wait, in the example where they gave a command like \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\" that uses speak. So if they just need to give a message to pause or stop, it's done with speak.\n\nSo, putting it all together: navigate to C&D - Main Entrance and then tell the robot to wait for 10 minutes. Since I can't specify \"wait\" as a function, I have to use \"speak\" instead.\n\nBut how does that translate into actions? Let me look at the example in the problem where they had a command like \"hand me the keys?\" So when giving a command, it's done by providing an input. Similarly, waiting requires telling the robot to stop moving, which is a different action than navigating.\n\nWait, but in the first part of their request, they just said \"Robot, proceed...wait for 10 minutes.\" Maybe that includes the command inside the waypoint name? No, because the waypoint name is \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" and within it, there's a command. But in reality, each waypoint is its own action.\n\nWait no, each waypoint is an independent task. So if I have a waypoint named \"C&D - Main Entrance\" with coordinates (0,0), then navigate to that spot. Then, after that, the user wants to give a message. So perhaps it's just a speak action because they are telling the robot to do something else.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when using commands like \"hand me the keys,\" it's done by giving an input to speak. So maybe for waiting, I need to do something different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after navigating, I can give a command to stop moving, which might be another action. But since the problem doesn't specify that, and given the example where they had a message prompting them to wait, perhaps it's just using speak again.\n\nWait, but in reality, maybe the waiting requires more than just speaking; it involves stopping movement. So in terms of the problem's functions, if I can't give \"navigate\" or \"speak,\" then for \"wait,\" I have to use \"speak.\" But how does that translate into actions?\n\nHmm, perhaps I should structure the actions as: first navigate to C&D Main Entrance, then after that, tell the robot to wait. Since I can't specify \"wait,\" I need to give a command that tells it to stop moving.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's example where they gave a message and received an answer, perhaps in this case, it's just using speak again because it's about giving a specific instruction.\n\nWait, but the query didn't say anything about giving an answer; it was just asking for a command. So maybe I need to specify that as a command, which would be either navigate or speak. But since we have already navigated, perhaps the next step is to give a message using speak.\n\nSo in total, two actions: one to navigate and another to give a message. But wait, does \"speak\" handle multiple commands? Or do I need to use separate actions?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's example where they gave a command like \"hand me the keys?\" with an input, it was just one action of speak. So perhaps in this case, after navigating, giving another message would be done by speaking again.\n\nWait, but maybe the waiting is part of the move sequence and isn't a function. So to stop moving, I have to give a command that tells the robot to halt. But since \"navigate\" includes all movement, stopping it requires more than just navigating\u2014so perhaps it's not supported by a function.\n\nIn the problem statement's example, they used speak to prompt a message, so maybe for waiting, I have to use speak again, even though it's not a function. Or perhaps wait isn't a function but part of the input when you want to stop moving.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after navigating to C&D Main Entrance, I can give an input in speak that tells the robot to stop moving or pause. But the problem statement doesn't specify any functions for that.\n\nWait, but the initial waypoint is \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" and within it, there's a command: \" Robot, proceed ... wait.\" So perhaps that command is part of the waypoint name. But in reality, each waypoint is separate from commands. So maybe I have to navigate separately, and after getting there, I can give another message using speak.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the actions would be:\n1. Navigate to C&D Main Entrance (using \"navigate\").\n2. Then, tell the robot to wait for 10 minutes by giving a command that tells it to stop moving or pause. Since I can't specify \"wait,\" perhaps I have to use speak again with an input like \"stop moving.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a function for stopping movement. Let me check the available functions: navigate, speak, and wait. So no function named \"stop.\" Therefore, it has to be done by giving a command using speak.\n\nSo after navigating, I can give a message in speak that tells the robot to stop or pause. That would satisfy the waiting requirement.\n</think>\n\nThe required actions are:\n1. Navigate to C&D - Main Entrance (navigate action).\n2.
