    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this prompt step by step. The user wants me to take their message to the HubRobo. First, I need to understand what that entails.\n\nLooking at the available functions and steps, taking something up from a waypoint probably means navigating to a specific location. So, my first thought is that \"HubRobo\" might be a waypoint name or part of one. But wait, checking the list of known waypoints, there's no direct match for HubRobo.\n\nSo, I need to check if any known waypoint can guide me towards HubRobo. Scanning through the waypoint names: navigate, speak, and wait are the main functions, but they don't seem to include \"HubRobo.\" The available waypoint names themselves also don't have that prefix or structure.\n\nSince none of the predefined waypoints match the intended action of taking someone up to HubRobo, I should output an action indicating that there's no known waypoint. That means responding with a speak action and inputting \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nI need to make sure this falls under the advanced fuzzy matching rules. The normalized names don't match because HubRobo isn't present, so it should correctly fall through to the unknown waypoint handling.\n\nAlso, since the request is straightforward but unclear (just \"take my to\"), there's no ambiguity in the command itself. It's a simple direction without additional steps or conditions, so no need for backtracking in this case.\n\nTherefore, the response should clearly state that HubRobo isn't recognized and offer assistance with any valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'HubRobo' is not a known waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
