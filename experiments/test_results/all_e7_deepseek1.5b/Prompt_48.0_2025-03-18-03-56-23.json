    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user with their prompt. The task is to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, from the available waypoints, there are two relevant ones: E5 Entrance and Micowaves. So the first action would be navigating to the E5 Entrance. I should check if that waypoint is in our known list.\n\nLooking at the user prompt, they want to go from the current location (0,0) to E5 Entrance. Let's see what the E5 Entrance looks like. From the provided data, E5 Entrance has a name and coordinates: \"E5 Entrance, Room 217\" with x=89 and y=64.\n\nNow, I need to normalize both inputs. The user is starting at (0,0), so any token there would be removed. Since neither waypoint names nor their normalized versions are in the known list, the similarity calculation will have to look for tokens from either E5 Entrance or Micowaves that appear in the user's input.\n\nThe user's input includes \"E5 Entrance\" which is exactly a known waypoint. So, navigating there should match without any issues. The next step after E5 Entrance is finding the Microwaves. Let me check if Micowaves is among the known waypoints.\n\nLooking back at the data, the Micawmas' name is \"Micowaves, Room 341\". But wait, in our list of waypoints, there's a waypoint named \"Micawmas\", not \"Micowaves\". So the user might be referring to a different one. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be \"Micowaves\".\n\nAssuming it's \"Micowaves\" as defined in the data, I need to see if that's available. Wait, checking again, in the waypoint list provided, there isn't a \"Micawmas\" or \"Micowaves\". The waypoint named \"Micawmas\" is mentioned, but \"Micowaves\" is not listed. That might be an issue.\n\nWait, looking back, no, actually in the data provided, under waypoint names, I don't see \"Micowaves\". The closest is \"Micawmas\" and \"Miwaves\", which are two different things. Maybe that's a typo or confusion between two words.\n\nBut for the sake of this example, let's assume that \"Micowaves\" isn't in our known list. So when the user mentions Micowaves, perhaps it refers to another waypoint or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a specific location named Micawmas or Micawve.\n\nWait, looking back at the data: There are two entries with \"Miwaves\": one called \"Micawmas\" and another called \"Miwaves\". So in the list of known waypoints, there's a waypoint named \"Miwaves\" which is an entry. Let me check that.\n\nLooking through the waypoint data provided, under waypoint names, I see:\n\n\"Miwaves, Room 123\"\n\nSo yes, \"Miwaves\" is available as a waypoint name. So if the user says \" Micowaves\", they might be referring to \"Miwaves\". Alternatively, perhaps it's another entry.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo, and the user meant \"Micawmas\". But since I don't have that in our known list, we need to proceed with what we have.\n\nSo for finding the Micawmas, the steps would be: navigate from E5 Entrance to Micawmas. Let me check if that's in the known waypoints.\n\nFrom the data provided, there isn't a waypoint named \"Micawmas\". The closest is \"Miwaves\" and \"Micawves\", but I don't see a \"Micawmas\".\n\nWait, actually looking back at the data:\n\nThere is a waypoint called \"Miwaves\" with a name \"Micawmas, Room 123\". So perhaps that's where Micawmas comes from. But the user might mean \"Miwaves\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different word altogether.\n\nThis could be an issue because without knowing exactly what the user is referring to, it's hard to match. However, assuming that \"Micawmas\" isn't in our list and \"Miwaves\" is, then Micawmas would require navigating from E5 Entrance to Miwaves' location.\n\nBut wait, let me check: The data provided doesn't have a waypoint with name \"Micawmas\". It does have one called \"Miwaves\", which I believe refers to another place. So perhaps the user intended \"Micawmas\" but didn't type it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the prompt, and \"Micowaves\" is meant to be \"Miwaves\".\n\nGiven that, for the purpose of this example, let's assume that \" Micawmas\" isn't available. Therefore, after navigating to E5 Entrance, the user would need to find another waypoint named \"Miwaves\", which I believe is present.\n\nSo summarizing: navigate from (0,0) to E5 Entrance, then from there to Miwaves' location. Each of these steps should be handled by navigating through the respective waypoints.\n\nThus, the final response would outline each step clearly.\n</think>\n\nTo follow your prompt of traveling to the E5 Entrance and then finding the Micawmas (assuming that refers to Miwaves), here are the steps:\n\n1. **Navigate to the E5 Entrance**:\n   - Starting from your current position (0,0), navigate through the waypoints to reach \"E5 Entrance, Room 217\".\n   - Ensure you check for any mismatches or typos in the waypoint names.\n\n2. **Find the Micawmas (assuming it's a typo and should be Miwaves)**:\n   - From E5 Entrance, navigate to \"Miwaves, Room 123\".\n   - Ensure this is accessible through your navigation system.\n\nEach of these steps will guide you to the desired locations, allowing you to complete your journey successfully.",
