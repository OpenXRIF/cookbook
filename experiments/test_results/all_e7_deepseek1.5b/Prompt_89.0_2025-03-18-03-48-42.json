    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the given prompt. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user's instruction is: \"Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" The available waypoint names are like \"C&D - Coffee Area\", \"Microwaves\", etc., but I'm not sure about all of them. From the list provided earlier, there's a \"Microwaves\" waypoint which has specific tokens: F, o, o, d, H, e, a, t, i, n, g, E, a, t, i, n, g.\n\nNow, looking at the prompt again, it mentions using words like 'North Entrance' and saying that out loud. But wait, in the available waypoint names, there's a 'Microwaves' but not a direct mention of 'North Entrance'. So does this mean I need to create a new waypoint or maybe check if it's already covered?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the task details. The user provided a list of waypoints with specific tokens, and for each input, there are known options. But in this case, the prompt is about commands that involve moving to a location and outputting a message.\n\nHmm, maybe 'North Entrance' isn't one of the known waypoint names. So perhaps I need to generate a new action based on the input. Let me check if any waypoint matches the \"N\" letter. Looking through the list:\n\n- Microwaves: F, o, o, d... No N.\nWait, is there a waypoint named \"North\"? In the available list, it's not listed. So I don't have that as a known waypoint.\n\nBut the prompt says 'proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.' Wait, does that mean just using the waypoint name directly?\n\nI think perhaps I can create an action where the user goes to the predefined location (like North Entrance) and outputs the message. So in terms of functions, navigate and speak would be used.\n\nSo putting it all together: first, navigate to North Entrance, which is a known waypoint, then say 'North Entrance' out loud with speak. Since both are predefined actions, I can do them one after another.\n\nI should make sure that the input correctly references the waypoint name without any extra tokens that might be considered non-essential. But since it's directly using the waypoint name, I think it's fine.\n\nSo the output would include two actions: navigate to North Entrance and then speak the message. The input is just the names of the waypoints.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"North Entrance\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"North Entrance\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
