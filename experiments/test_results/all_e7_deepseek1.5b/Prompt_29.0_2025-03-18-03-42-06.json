    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a detailed prompt and an example of what they want from their system. They're asking for something specific related to waypoints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules for matching waypoint names. From the prompt, it says that when a user asks about a waypoint name, we have to compare it with the known list of waypoints. The process involves normalization, tokenization, and checking each token from the waypoint against the normalized input.\n\nSo, the example given is asking about an unknown waypoint called 'unknown zone', which returns an action message saying the waypoint doesn't exist. That makes sense because there's no such waypoint in the list.\n\nNow, for the user prompt they provided: \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Go to the C&D\". I need to break this down into steps.\n\nFirst part of the query is about finding the number of entrances to E7. Looking at the available waypoints, the one called 'E7' probably corresponds to an Entrance. Then, the second part is to go to C&D, which might have its own specific entry.\n\nI should check if there's a waypoint named 'Entrance'. From the provided data, I don't see 'Entrance' as a waypoint name. The closest might be 'Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic', but that doesn't seem related. So, maybe 'Entrance' isn't in the list.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the query is invalid because there's no known way to find how many entrances are at E7. Hence, the system should output an action suggesting that this waypoint does not exist.\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting each token correctly. Both parts of the query have to match existing waypoints. The first part is about 'E7', which isn't present, and then 'C&D' which has its own entry but perhaps doesn't relate directly to the E7 information needed.\n\nSo, the response should be that there's no such waypoint for how many entrances are at E7, hence the action is to speak with an error message.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7' is not a known waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
