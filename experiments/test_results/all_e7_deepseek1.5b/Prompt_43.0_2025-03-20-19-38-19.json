For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"\n",

    "Data Set": "E7-1",
    "Experiment ID": 6.0,
    "Prompt ID": 43.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the prompt \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the user's prompt, it's a request that involves moving to a specific location called the \"E7 silent study.\" The key here is understanding what constitutes a waypoint and how the input can be matched against existing ones.\n\nFrom the available waypoints in the given context, I see there are several. For example, E7 might refer to an area or room number associated with E7. However, when processing the prompt \"take me to the E7 silent study,\" I need to determine if such a waypoint exists and how it's structured.\n\nThe normalized version of the input would be \"e7silentstudy.\" The known waypoints have names like \"E7 silent study\" or variations where letters are capitalized at the beginning. Comparing this, I notice that one of the known waypoints is E7 Silent Study, which could match \"e7silentstudy.\" \n\nNow, looking at the available waypoint names, there's a waypoint named \"E7 Silent Study.\" So, after normalizing and removing extraneous tokens (though in this case, it seems none are present), I can see that this waypoint exists.\n\nNext, checking for similarity. The normalized input is 6 letters long. The waypoint name \"E7 Silent Study\" has 14 words. To meet the criteria of a high percentage presence, like at least 80%, we need to check if every token in the user's query matches part of the waypoint's tokens.\n\nThe user's input \"take me to the E7 silent study.\" includes tokens: take, me, go, to, the, E7, silent, study. These match parts of the waypoint name. However, since it's a left-to-right processing and commands are handled in order, I can treat this as a navigate action where the user starts at their current location and navigates to the waypoint.\n\nWait, no. The user is requesting a command, so maybe it's not just navigating but executing an action. Let me check the supported edge cases again. The task says that commands are processed in left-to-right unless specified otherwise. So for \"take me to...\", I'm not sure if it's navigate or speak.\n\nWait, no. The user prompt is a request, which suggests speaking, so perhaps navigating is part of it. But maybe this isn't a waypoint lookup but more like a command to move to the study. Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the available waypoints, \"E7 Silent Study\" exists, which might be the desired endpoint. So the action would be navigate from current location to E7 Silent Study.\n\nWait, no. Let's go back. The user is asking for \"take me to the E7 silent study.\" That sounds like a direct instruction: take someone to that specific area. But in the context of this system, I think commands are processed as actions within the framework, and moving might not be a standard action but perhaps part of the navigation.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, for instance, when they navigate from C&D Coffee Area to RoboHub, it's two separate actions. So maybe this is also a two-step process: first navigating to E7 Silent Study, then navigating to RoboHub? Or perhaps just navigating directly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this isn't a waypoint lookup but a direct instruction to go to the study. But since \"take me\" is part of the request, it's more like a command than an action.\n\nBut wait, looking at the supported edge cases, if a waypoint doesn't exist, it returns a speak action with error. So perhaps for this prompt, as long as the waypoint exists, we can process it.\n\nWait, but in the given example responses, when moving from one place to another is required, they navigate step by step. Maybe here, just navigating to E7 Silent Study is sufficient, and then to RoboHub? But I think that might not be necessary because the user hasn't specified needing to go back.\n\nSo perhaps it's a simple request: take someone to E7 Silent Study. Since it's about moving, maybe navigate from current location to E7 Silent Study. Or if the user is already at the current location and wants to move there, that would require navigating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this isn't about navigation but rather about executing an action as per the instruction given. But since it's a command, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the system interprets \"take me to\" as navigating from wherever you are to the specified waypoint. So if you're at your current location and want to go to E7 Silent Study, that would be a navigate action with the target being E7 Silent Study.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about requesting someone to move there, which could involve both actions: speaking to the person (speak) and navigating (navigate).\n\nBut in this case, since the system isn't listening for a person's name, perhaps it's just a directive. So I need to determine if \"take me to the E7 silent study.\" can be processed as an action that navigates.\n\nWait, but looking at the given examples, when moving between two waypoints is needed, they navigate each time. So maybe in this case, only navigating once from current to E7 Silent Study is enough, and then another command for RoboHub.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the structure of the waypoint names. They have \"E7\" capitalized as part of the name. The known waypoints include E7 Silent Study, which might be the target.\n\nSo after matching, since \"take me to the E7 silent study.\" exists in the list (assuming slight variations are acceptable), I can process it as a navigate action from current location to E7 Silent Study.\n\nTherefore, the system should respond with a navigate action targeting E7 Silent Study.\n</think>\n\nThe task is processed by identifying the waypoint \"E7 Silent Study\" and executing a navigate action. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Normalization:** Convert the input message to lowercase for uniformity: `take me to the e7silentstudy.`.\n\n2. **Normalization of Waypoints:** Check if any known waypoint names match the normalized input, considering that \"E7\" is capitalized and may be part of the name in some cases (e.g., \"E7 Silent Study\").\n\n3. **Waypoint Match:** Identify the waypoint \"E7 Silent Study\", which exists.\n\n4. **Processing the Request:** Determine if this request is about navigating from the current location to E7 Silent Study.\n\n5. **Action Execution:** Execute a navigate action targeting E7 Silent Study.\n\n6. **Output Response:** Return a response indicating navigation to E7 Silent Study, possibly requiring further confirmation or handling based on system capabilities.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nYou are requested to navigate to the E7 Silent Study area.",
