    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user says, \"It's too loud here! Let's go Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out RoboHub.\" So they're talking about moving to Silent Study room 102 and then heading to RoboHub in Room 429 after that. \n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I don't see anything related to rooms or specific locations like Silent Study or RoboHub. The known waypoint names are about places such as \"C and D areas,\" \"Coffee Room 102,\" \"RoboHub Entrance,\" etc., but not about room numbers.\n\nI should check if there's a waypoint for each of these addresses. Silent Study is mentioned, so I'll look up if there's a waypoint named \"Silent Study.\" Similarly, RoboHub is present with its entrance. But Silent Study doesn't have a direct corresponding waypoint.\n\nSo, without any waypoints that match the locations specified in the user's request, the system should respond by saying the action is to speak and input that it doesn't exist. That way, the user knows there are no known options for these specific rooms.\n\nI need to make sure my response follows the guidelines provided. Since I can't find any matching waypoints, I'll follow the \"unknown waypoint\" section where it says to output an action with \"speak\" and the message that it doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Silent Study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
