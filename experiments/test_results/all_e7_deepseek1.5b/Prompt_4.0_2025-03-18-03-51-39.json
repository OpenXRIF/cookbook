    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The prompt says, \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" First, I need to check if there's a waypoint named C&D - Coffee Area in the list provided.\n\nLooking through the known waypoints, I see entries like C&D - Coffee Area, but I don't see it listed. The user mentioned that starting locations are at 0.0,0.0, and the available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So, I can only move if there's a waypoint named C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nSince it's not in the list, the system should respond by saying \"invalid waypoint.\" But let me double-check to make sure. The user didn't mention any other waypoint that starts with \"C&D\". They only listed entries for different zones like South Entrance, and various coffee areas.\n\nTherefore, I conclude there's no valid waypoint matching the request. So, the response should be as per the guidelines: an action of speaking with the input message indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe request is to \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" \n\nHowever, from the known waypoints provided, there isn't a waypoint named \"C&D - Coffee Area.\"\n\nTherefore, the response should indicate that the waypoint does not exist.\n\n**Actions:** {\"actions\": [{\"action\": \"speak\", \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"}]}\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
    "XRIF Generated": "{\"actions\": [{\"action\": \"speak\", \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"}]}The final answer is:```json{  \"actions\": [    {      \"action\": \"speak\",      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"    }  ]}",
