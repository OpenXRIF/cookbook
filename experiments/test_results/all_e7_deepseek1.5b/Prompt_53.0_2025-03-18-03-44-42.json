    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond when someone asks me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the user's prompt, they want me to navigate from a starting point to the E5 Entrance and then go to the Micawaves area. I remember that each waypoint has specific locations in a coordinate system with X and Y coordinates.\n\nThe first thing I should do is find the E5 Entrance's location. From the list of waypoints, I see there are several known ones, but I need to figure out which one corresponds to E5. Since E5 isn't an available waypoint yet, if it were, its coordinates would be important. But right now, since the user hasn't provided a waypoint for E5, I might have to mention that it's not listed.\n\nNext, after arriving at the E5 Entrance, the user wants me to find the Micawaves area. Again, I don't see an entry for Micawaves as a known waypoint, but if there were one with coordinates, that would be where I need to go next.\n\nI also have to ensure that my response is structured in a way that follows all the given guidelines. The user's prompt seems straightforward, so I don't think I'll need to handle any complex commands or additional steps beyond confirming the waypoint locations and the functions required.\n\nSince both E5 Entrance and Micawaves are unknown waypoints, I should inform the user about that. The response needs to be in JSON format, starting with \"actions\":, followed by an array of actions like navigate, speak, etc., or if it's a spoken command without action, just \"speak\" with the input.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases. If both waypoints are unknown, I should return a message similar to the examples where a waypoint is invalid. In this case, since E5 and Micawaves are both unknown, I'll mention that they aren't valid waypoints but can be located if provided.\n\nPutting it all together, my response should inform the user about the unknown waypoints with their coordinates, state that further location information is required, and suggest using the navigate function from the respective locations. If no such command is given, then a speak action explaining the request should suffice.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"E5 Entrance and Micawaves are not valid waypoints and their coordinates have not been provided.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
