    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The prompt says, \"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of request this is. It seems like the user is talking about making a series of commands or actions in sequence. They mentioned going to places named after waypoints, which are probably locations like Silent Study and RoboHub.\n\nLooking back at the examples, when the user asks for specific things, like keys or asking someone for directions, they use different actions and give input details. For example, \"speak\" can be used with an input that includes a waypoint name and its coordinates.\n\nSince this prompt is about going to places named after waypoints, I need to see if any of the known waypoints match the locations mentioned: Silent Study and RoboHub. The available waypoints include places like Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, Silent Zone, etc.\n\nI don't recognize \"Silent Study\" or \"RoboHub\" as waypoint names from the given list. So, it's probably an unknown waypoint. According to the handling of complex commands, if a command is invalid or ambiguous and beyond the supported actions (which are navigate, speak, wait), I should return a single speak action with an error message.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the known waypoints include RoboHub Entrance and Silent Zone, among others. Maybe \"RoboHub\" is one of them. Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the available waypoint names, there's a \"RoboHub Entrance\" listed. But then I see \"Silent Zone,\" which doesn't match \"Silent Study.\"\n\nSo, if neither Silent Study nor RoboHub are waypoints, it would be an unknown waypoint, leading to the speak action with the error message as per the handling rules.\n\nI should also make sure that there's no other waypoint matching these names. Since I don't see any others named exactly like \"Silent Study\" or \"RoboHub,\" it falls into the invalid waypoint category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
