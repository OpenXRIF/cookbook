    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" So, I need to figure out how to respond with the appropriate actions and inputs.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, I don't see an E7 Silent Study. The closest is E7 Coffee Area. That doesn't seem right because the user asked for a silent study. Maybe they meant E7 Silent Zone or something similar, but it's not listed.\n\nSince there's no waypoint matching \"E7 silent study,\" according to the guidelines, I should respond with an action that indicates the absence of a known waypoint. The example shows when a waypoint is unknown, it outputs actions like \"speak\" and the message saying the waypoint doesn't exist. That seems straightforward here.\n\nI don't think there are any additional commands or steps involved because the user just wants to go to a specific area without further instructions on how to reach it. So, I'll stick with the no- waypoint scenario.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7 silent study' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
