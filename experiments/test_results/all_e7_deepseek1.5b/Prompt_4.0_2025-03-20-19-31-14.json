For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this query. Let's see, the user provided a detailed prompt about handling waypoints and executing commands in a specific order. Their current request is to navigate from the South Entrance to the C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nFirst, I should check if \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is one of the known waypoint names. Looking at the available waypoints list, I don't see this exact entry. There's a \"C&D - Coffee Zone,\" which seems close but not exactly the same. The user specifically mentioned \"Coffee Area,\" so it's probably an abbreviation.\n\nNext, I need to match this waypoint against the known ones using fuzzy matching. Converting both the input and the waypoint names to lowercase helps in checking for similar tokens. Since \"Coffee\" is present and matches one of the waypoint names, this would be a match.\n\nSince \"C&D - Coffee Zone\" isn't listed as a waypoint, the system should respond by saying that it doesn't exist. So, I'll follow the steps outlined: normalize both inputs, check for extra tokens, tokenize them, calculate similarity, and then select the matching waypoint or fall back to output an action.\n\nIn this case, since \"C&D - Coffee Zone\" isn't a known waypoint, the system will generate an action to speak that the waypoint does not exist. I'll include the necessary input details like name and coordinates, but with placeholders since they aren't provided.\n</think>\n\nThe system should respond to the query by checking if the waypoint exists.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Normalization:** Both \"C&D - Coffee Zone\" and any associated waypoint names are converted to lowercase.\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:** Any tokens that might represent building codes or identifiers (like numbers) at the beginning of the input are discarded.\n3. **Tokenization:** Both the normalized user input (\"c&d - coffee zone\") and each known waypoint name (e.g., \"C&D - Coffee Zone\") are split into individual words.\n4. **Similarity Calculation:** The system checks if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input, allowing for a high percentage of tokens to be present without requiring an exact match. This ensures that additional non-essential prefixes can be included while still matching the basic structure.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n   - If no known waypoint matches or exceeds the similarity threshold, output an action.\n   - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince \"C&D - Coffee Zone\" is not among the available waypoints, the system cannot find a matching waypoint and should respond accordingly.",
