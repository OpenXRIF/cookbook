    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this query. The user provided a prompt asking to take someone to the E7 silent study. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints. There are several with names like E7 silent study, which seems important. Wait, isn't that exactly what the user is asking for? So that should be a match right there.\n\nBut let me double-check the steps they gave to make sure I'm following correctly. They mentioned normalizing both input and waypoint names by lowercasing them. Okay, so E7 silent study in lowercase would be \"e7 silent study\", and any other waypoint names given need to be lowercased too.\n\nNext, checking for extraneous tokens. If a token starts with numbers or has letters/digits, it's probably not an essential part of the name. But since our query is just taking someone there, I don't think that applies here.\n\nTokenization involves splitting into words. So \"take me to the E7 silent study.\" becomes [\"take\", \"me\", \"to\", \"the\", \"E7\", \"silent\", \"study\"]. Each of these needs to be matched against known waypoint names.\n\nLooking at the available waypoint list, I see that none have a name like \"E7 silent study\". Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I misread something or there's a typo? Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the waypoint for E7 silent study is there. It must be one of the options. So perhaps I need to look at the list provided and see if it's listed under the \"available functions\". Scanning through the available waypoints, there's definitely an option that says \"E7 silent study\".\n\nSo, when I match against the waypoint names, E7 silent study should trigger a match. That means no additional tokens are needed; just providing the name is enough.\n\nTherefore, the action here would be to navigate to the location specified by the waypoint. So in this case, navigating to E7 silent study's location. But since I don't have the coordinates of that specific waypoint, maybe it doesn't matter as long as I specify the correct name.\n\nWait, but looking back at the user prompt, the example had a waypoint with a specific location. Maybe all waypoints include their locations? Let me check.\n\nLooking through each waypoint's description and location section:\n\n- The first waypoint: \"E7 silent study\" probably has its own coordinates.\n- Then there are other waypoints listed like \"Room 1427 - Coffee Area\", which also have specific coordinates.\n\nSo, in the given example, the user prompt is to take me to E7 silent study. Since that's a known waypoint, it should be matched without any issues.\n\nTherefore, I can proceed with handling this as a valid action where \"navigate\" is selected because there's no need for additional commands beyond navigating to the specified location.\n\nBut hold on, in some cases, if the user specifies more than just the waypoint name, they might add an input field. In this case, since it's just taking them somewhere without any extra steps or directions, the only action needed is \"navigate\".\n\nSo yes, I think that's correct. Just outputting \"navigate\" with the corresponding location information will suffice.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E7 silent study\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
