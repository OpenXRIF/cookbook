    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query of \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" First, I'll look at the available waypoints. The closest one is E & S Silent Study, which doesn't exist yet.\n\nI remember that when matching waypoint names, we check if all tokens are present in the input. So 'E', '7', 'silent', 'study' aren't all there. Even with some extra tokens like prefixes or suffixes, it's unlikely a match. There's also an ambiguity because \"take me to\" could mean different things\u2014navigate, speak, wait.\n\nThe example given shows that when the waypoint isn't available, we return an action to speak and mention it doesn't exist. That makes sense. Since there are no other options, I'll follow that structure.\n</think>\n\nTo respond to your query, since \"E7 silent study\" is not a known waypoint in our list, here's what I can do:\n\n1. **Detect the Ambiguity**: The command requires multiple functions (\"navigate\", \"speak\", \"wait\"), which are beyond our predefined actions.\n\n2. **Output an Error Message**: According to the supported edge cases, if any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, I should return a single speak action with an error message.\n\nSo, my response will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis effectively communicates that the requested waypoint doesn't exist and requests further clarification.",
