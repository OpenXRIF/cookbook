    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. So, the user wrote, \"I'm feeling peckish. Can we swing by the C&D - Snack Area and then grab a drink at the C&D - Cold Drink Aeria?\" Hmm, okay, I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with waypoints, the process is pretty straightforward but needs careful attention. The user wants to perform certain actions related to two different areas: a snack area and a drink area in the C&D zone. Also, they mention feeling peckish, which suggests they might be looking for a place to eat or grab some drink.\n\nLooking back at the example given earlier, I see that when a user asks for an action like \"grabs a drink,\" it's specified by providing the waypoint name and its coordinates. That makes sense because you need both the area and the exact location where you want to be once you perform the action.\n\nNow, applying this to the current prompt. The user is feeling peckish, so they might be looking for a place to eat or grab food nearby. They mention wanting to swing by the C&D - Snack Area and then grab a drink at the C&D - Cold Drink Aeria. So, I need to identify the waypoint names: \"Snack Area\" and \"ColdDrinkDrinksArea.\" But wait, in the examples provided earlier, when someone asks for an action related to grabbing food, they have to provide both the area name and its coordinates.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I don't see any that directly mention a place where you can grab food or get food. The known waypoint names are all about areas and their locations. For example, \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" is a specific area. But the user's prompt doesn't specify a waypoint that handles both the snack area and the drink area in the same command.\n\nAlso, I notice that when people ask for an action like \"grab a drink,\" they provide the waypoint name along with its coordinates. Since this request involves two separate waypoints (Snack Area and ColdDrinkDrinksArea), but there's no known waypoint that handles both, it seems like there's ambiguity here.\n\nFurthermore, in the advanced fuzzy matching steps, if multiple waypoint names don't match exactly, the system might consider them as partial matches or additional tokens. However, without a waypoint specifically designed for both snack area and drink area, it's challenging to parse this request accurately.\n\nIn the examples provided earlier, when there were two waypoints that fit well but weren't matching each other, the system would select the one with higher similarity. But in this case, since no waypoint names have both the Snack Area and the Drink Area specified together, the system might default to selecting the most similar one or perhaps treat it as an unsupported command.\n\nAdditionally, considering the supported actions, if any beyond \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" or \"wait\" are requested, the response should be a single speak action with an error. But since this prompt doesn't specify any of those, it might just default to speaking and saying that there's no valid waypoint for both areas.\n\nWait, let me double-check the available waypoints again. The user provided a list of waypoints, but none seem to address both the Snack Area and the Drink Area in their request. So, I'm leaning towards needing more information or perhaps an error message because it's not a known waypoint that can handle this combination.\n\nIn conclusion, since there are no waypoint names specifically for the C&D - Snack Area and C&D - ColdDrinkDrinksArea together, the system might need to either provide an unsupported action with a spoken response saying \"invalid request\" or perhaps treat it as such because it's beyond the known waypoints. \n\nBut looking back at the examples given earlier, when there were two waypoint names, one was selected even if they were different because of higher similarity. So, in this case, since \"Snack Area\" is more specific than \"ColdDrinkDrinksArea,\" maybe it's chosen first or based on some other criteria.\n\nWait, but I need to follow the steps provided for fuzzy matching. After normalization and tokenization, each waypoint name is compared against the user input. So, if there are multiple waypoints that have some similarity, how do we decide which one to choose?\n\nIn such cases, perhaps the system would prioritize shorter or more specific names first. Alternatively, maybe it's just treated as an unsupported command because no waypoint covers both areas.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct action here is to output a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist\" since there's no known waypoint that can handle both the Snack Area and the Drink Area simultaneously.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
