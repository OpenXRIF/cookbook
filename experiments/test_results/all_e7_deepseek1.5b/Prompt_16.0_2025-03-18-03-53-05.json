    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to process this user prompt. The task involves matching a command to a known waypoint and generating appropriate actions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the user is asking. They want to go check out the Novelties store and then head out the South Entrence. From the examples given earlier, I see that the function \"navigate\" is used for moving around the building areas, like the Coffee Area or RoboHub Entrance.\n\nThe known waypoint names are listed in both the role section and the understanding user prompts. Each of these has a name, a normalized form (lowercase), an available functions list (\"navigate\", \"speak\", \"wait\"), and some extra details about their structure.\n\nLooking at the query prompt: \"Let's chek out the Novelties store, and then head out the South Entrence.\" The first part is checking out the Novelties store. I need to see if there's a waypoint named \"Novelties\" that could be associated with this location.\n\nReviewing the waypoint names provided:\n\n- Novelties Store: 50\n- RoboHub: 62\n- Coffee Area: 140\n- Room 324 - Concepts: 74\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic: 89\n\nSo, \"Novelties\" isn't one of the waypoint names. But maybe there's a function or an area named Novelties that I'm missing? Looking through the available waypoints, none seem to have \"Novelties\". The closest might be \"Room 324 - Concepts\", but it doesn't directly relate to the store.\n\nThe user is asking to check out the Novelties store. If there's no waypoint named \"Novelties Store\", I should consider if there's a nearby area or function that can help them access it. However, from the available information, none of the known waypoints fit this request exactly.\n\nSince \"Novelties\" isn't a waypoint, and there's no other way to navigate to the Novelties store from the given list, I need to decide what actions to take. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown or not found in the available list, an action with the message \"This waypoint does not exist\" should be returned.\n\nSo, the user wants to check out the Novelties store and then head to South Entrence. Since there's no waypoint named \"Novelties Store\", I can't perform the first part of the task as required. This means the entire request is invalid based on the known waypoints.\n\nI need to structure this into actions. The user wants them to go to the Novelties store and then to South Entrence. Since there's no way to reach the Novelties store, I should probably inform them that this action isn't possible with the provided information.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should include a \"speak\" action instructing the user about the unavailable waypoint and possibly suggesting additional steps if they can't proceed further.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Novelties Store' is not a known waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
