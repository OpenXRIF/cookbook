For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. They want me to start at the South Entrance and then go to the C&D - Coffee Area. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, there's no \"South Entrance\". The closest is the South Zone which has a starting location of 0,0. So I can't use that unless it's considered part of an action like navigate or speak. But since there's no direct way to start from the South Entrance, maybe I should look for other actions that can help.\n\nI remember that when matching waypoints, if none match exactly, we have to do a left-to-right scan. So let me check each known waypoint against this request. \n\nThe user starts at the South Zone because it's their starting point. That probably means \"navigate\" is necessary there. Once inside, they need to get to C&D - Coffee Area. Looking at the available waypoints, I don't see an exact match for that. The closest thing is C&D - Coffee Area, which has a location of 100,100.\n\nSo, first action: navigate from South Zone (starting at 0,0) to some point. Since it's not exactly known where the coffee area is, maybe I can just speak and ask for the location? Wait, but that might not be possible as it needs a waypoint. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with \"navigate\" to C&D - Coffee Area from the South Zone. But since there's no exact match for C&D - Coffee Area, how do I handle that?\n\nWait, in the understanding steps, if none of the known waypoints exactly match, but can be matched by adding tokens, then I might have to find the closest one. So perhaps navigate to C&D - Coffee Area from the South Zone, even though it's not an exact waypoint.\n\nBut wait, is there a waypoint named C&D - Coffee Area? Let me check. Oh, yes! The known waypoints include \"C&D - Coffee Area\" with a location of 100,100. So that should work. \n\nSo the plan is: first navigate to the South Zone from Start (0,0). Once there, take another action to go to C&D - Coffee Area since it's not an exact match.\n\nWait, but does the user want to start at the South Entrance and then go to the coffee area? So maybe:\n\n1. Navigate from Start (0,0) to South Zone.\n2. Then navigate from South Zone to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary because starting there is enough for navigation. Alternatively, just using a known waypoint named C&D - Coffee Area would suffice as it exists.\n\nSo the steps would be: navigate once from Start to South Zone (0,0) to (0,0), then go to C&D - Coffee Area at 100,100. That should cover both points.\n\nI think that's how to respond. Let me outline the actions step by step.\n</think>\n\nTo fulfill the user's request of starting at the South Entrance and navigating to the C&D - Coffee Area, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigate from Start (0,0) to South Zone**: This is necessary since there's no direct way to start navigation from the South Entrance.\n\n2. **Navigate from South Zone to C&D - Coffee Area**: Once inside the South Zone, use a known waypoint named \"C&D - Coffee Area\" for precise navigation.\n\nThese actions will allow the user to follow their instructions accurately using available waypoints and functions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Start\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"South Zone\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
