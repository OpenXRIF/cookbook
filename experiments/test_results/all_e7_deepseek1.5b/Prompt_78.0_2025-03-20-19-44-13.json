For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem where I have to process a series of commands based on waypoints and navigate from one point to another. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The user provided a detailed prompt that outlines several waypoints and commands in a specific order. They want the system to execute these tasks as instructed without getting confused or making any mistakes.\n\nOkay, let's start with parsing the input. The input is a string of commands, which can include waypoint names followed by actions like navigate, speak, wait. I need to extract all these waypoints and actions first. So, I'll go through each token in the input, check if it starts with a lowercase letter or a number, remove any extraneous tokens (like those at the beginning that don't make sense), split them into words for both the waypoint names and the commands.\n\nOnce I have all the waypoints and actions extracted, I need to process them in order. The processing should be left-to-right unless there are specific instructions otherwise, like multiple steps or backtracking. So, if a command requires choosing between different actions, I'll have to pick the one that fits best without causing issues later on.\n\nNow, looking at the supported edge cases: If any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is requested, return an action with \"speak\" and the error message. Also, if the input doesn't match a known waypoint, return the speak action with the message about the waypoint not existing.\n\nIn the example provided in the prompt, it's clear that each command should be handled one after another, and any deviation might cause a re-match or an error. So, I need to ensure that all actions are processed sequentially without skipping any steps.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the complexity of commands. If there are multiple parts, like \"drop off at the Ideas Clinic\", it's important to break down each action into separate speak actions for clarity and proper processing.\n\nI also need to handle unknown waypoints correctly by returning a specific message. That means making sure that if any waypoint in the input isn't recognized, I just return the default speak action with an error.\n\nLet me outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Parse Input:** Extract all waypoints (their names and descriptions) and actions (like navigate to a place). Each word from the input is either part of a waypoint or a command.\n\n2. **Normalize Whway Names:** Convert both the user's input and each known waypoint name to lowercase. This helps in matching without considering case differences.\n\n3. **Extract Words:** Split normalized words into individual tokens for waypoints (names and descriptions) and actions (like navigate, speak, wait).\n\n4. **Check Match:** For each action, determine if it matches a waypoint. A match is confirmed if every token of the action appears in the input or there's at least an 80% overlap. If multiple waypoint names are close enough, select the highest matching one.\n\n5. **Process Commands:** Execute each command in order. Each command can be complex and involve multiple steps (like wait for a certain duration), so I'll need to handle these accordingly by possibly speaking, waiting, navigating back, etc.\n\n6. **Handle Edge Cases:** If at any point an unknown waypoint is encountered or if processing causes any issues beyond just re-matching, output the speak action with the error message.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this in code. I'll need a list of known waypoints with their names and descriptions. For each command, I'll extract the action and then check against this list to see which waypoint it matches best. The matching is based on token overlap with at least 80% coverage.\n\nI also need to handle actions that require multiple steps or specific functions beyond navigate, speak, wait. In such cases, return a predefined error message as per the supported edge case.\n\nLet me consider an example scenario: If someone asks to go from \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" and then to \"Silent Study\", I should first find the \"Silent Study\" waypoint. Then navigate back to \"ideas clinic\" (the opposite direction), wait, and proceed to the next command.\n\nI also need to think about potential issues like if the same action is used multiple times in a row, which might require re-evaluating the matching process. For instance, if I'm supposed to \"navigate to shower A\" followed by \"navigate to room 1427 - ideas clinic\", it's just adding another step to my current position.\n\nAnother consideration is the order of waypoints and actions. If a waypoint requires going through several others before reaching its name, I have to process them in that specific order unless there are no other options.\n\nI should also make sure that if two waypoints match equally well (same number of tokens or same overlap), I choose the one with higher priority based on how closely they're aligned with my current position. But since the input is static, this might not be applicable here; perhaps it's better to handle waypoint names as per their descriptions and see which aligns best.\n\nWait, but each waypoint has a name description. So, for example, if there are two waypoints that share similar tokens, I need to determine which one is more likely based on the description. That might require comparing token overlaps with actual context from both the user's input and the waypoint descriptions.\n\nThis could get complicated, especially since it depends on understanding how each waypoint was intended to be used. Without knowing all possible uses of each waypoint, matching them based solely on overlapping tokens would lead to errors or misinterpretations.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in this case, I have to prioritize waypoints that are closer in name and context. But given that the input is fixed, I might not always know how a particular waypoint should be used. This makes it tricky because I can't automatically assume all uses are correct; each needs to be handled based on the user's specific instructions.\n\nIn such a scenario, maybe the approach would involve prioritizing waypoints that have similar or exact names first and then moving to more detailed ones if the name doesn't match but the context does. But without knowing the broader usage of each waypoint, it's hard to implement this logic.\n\nI guess in practice, with limited information about how each waypoint was used before, the best I can do is rely on token overlap for matching, even though it might not handle all edge cases perfectly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that after processing a command, my position changes based on the last action. So if I'm at \"room 1427 - ideas clinic\" and then navigate back, I have to adjust my current location accordingly.\n\nI also need to make sure that when I process multiple commands in sequence, each subsequent action is correctly relative to my current position after each step.\n\nThis seems manageable, but the complexity could grow with more intricate commands or more waypoints. However, for the given prompt and steps outlined earlier, this approach should work.\n\nFinally, if none of the waypoints match, I have to return a specific error message as per the supported edge case. This covers situations where the input doesn't contain any valid waypoint names that can be processed.\n\nAlright, with all these thoughts in mind, let's structure the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo address the problem, we'll outline a clear and organized approach to process each command based on predefined waypoints and navigate through them step-by-step. Here's how it will work:\n\n1. **Parse Input:**\n   - Extract all waypoints (their names and descriptions) and actions (like navigate to a place).\n\n2. **Normalize Whway Names:**\n   - Convert both the user's input and each known waypoint name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.\n\n3. **Extract Words:**\n   - Split normalized words into individual tokens for waypoints and actions.\n\n4. **Match Actions to Waypoints:**\n   - For each action, check against the known waypoints.\n   - A match is confirmed if every token of the action appears in the input or there's at least an 80% overlap.\n\n5. **Process Commands:**\n   - Execute each command in order.\n   - Navigate back through waypoints as needed.\n   - Handle multiple steps or actions by adjusting position and re-evaluating waypoint matches.\n\n6. **Edge Cases Handling:**\n   - If unknown waypoints are encountered, return a specific error message.\n   - Return predefined messages for unsupported commands beyond navigate, speak, wait.\n\nThis approach ensures that each command is processed correctly based on the input and the predefined waypoints, while handling edge cases appropriately.",
