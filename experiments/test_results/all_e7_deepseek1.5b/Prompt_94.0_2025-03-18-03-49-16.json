    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user gave me this prompt about sending a robot to go to the North Entrance. I need to figure out how to respond using the tools provided.\n\nFirst, I remember that each waypoint has specific names and locations. The user mentioned something like \"North Entrance\" in their example. So I should look up what the North Entrance is named as.\n\nLooking at the data, under Waypoints, I see a section titled \"North Entrance\". Let me check: it's called \"N&D - North Entrance\". That makes sense because &D usually stands for Data Zone, so combining them with N gives North. The coordinates are 25,50. So the waypoint is N&D - North Entrance at (25,50).\n\nNext, I need to consider the user's command: \"Robot, proceed to [[North Entrance]], say 'North Entrance' out loud, and wait for 10 minutes.\" The robot should navigate to that location, say the name, and wait. Since it's already a waypoint, the robot can go directly there.\n\nSo, the actions needed are navigate to N&D - North Entrance with coordinates (25,50), say \"North Entrance\", and wait for 10 minutes. There's no ambiguity here because it's straightforward\u2014just navigating and then waiting.\n\nI should structure this in JSON format, making sure each action has the correct input and action name. The speak part can be done when the robot is ready to announce the entrance by saying \"North Entrance\".\n</think>\n\nThe user's prompt requires a command that sends a robot to the North Entrance. Based on the waypoint names, the North Entrance is named N&D - North Entrance with coordinates (25, 50). \n\n### Response:\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"N&D - North Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"North Entrance\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
