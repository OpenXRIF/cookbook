    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this task. The user has given a prompt that says, \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\" My job is to process this command into specific actions using the provided fuzzy matching system.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the command entails. It seems like the user wants someone to go to an elevator and then wait there for 15 seconds before heading to the East Entrance. So, the main steps are: getting to the elevator, waiting for it, and then finding the entrance.\n\nLooking at the system's rules, I see that commands need to be processed in a left-to-right sequence unless specified otherwise. That means \"take me\" should come first, followed by \"to the Elevators,\" then \"wait there for 15 seconds,\" and finally \"find the East Entrance.\"\n\nNow, each of these actions is handled by specific functions: Navigate, speak, and wait. I'll need to map each part of the command to these functions.\n\nStarting with \"take me to the Elevators.\" The system looks for waypoint names that start with a number or include numbers in their names. In this case, \"Elevators\" doesn't have letters but includes numbers (10 and 15). So I'll look through the known waypoint names to see which ones fit.\n\nThe known waypoints are:\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- speak\n- navigate\n- wait\n- speak\n\nHmm, none of these start with a number or include letters. Wait, \" speak\" is a function, not a waypoint name. So maybe I need to find the closest match. Looking at the waypoint names again, \"C&D - Coffee Area\" has letters but no numbers. Since 10 and 15 are needed, maybe it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Elevators\" isn't a known waypoint. In that case, none of the functions can be used because they all refer to known waypoints. So, I have to output an action with \"speak\" but explain why. It says if no waypoint is found and other actions aren't supported, it returns an error message.\n\nBut before that, let's see each part:\n\n1. Take me to the Elevators: Since there's no waypoint named \"Elevators\" or any similar, I can't process this function. So, maybe I have to use the speak action as a fallback? Or is it better to check if \"Elevators\" is present elsewhere.\n\nWait, the command includes 15 seconds wait, so perhaps we need to include that in the output actions. Let me think through each step:\n\n- Take me to the Elevators: No known waypoint for elevators. Maybe I can't process this function. So, perhaps the next action is to speak, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"take\" and \"to\" are part of speech commands? Looking at the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, return an error message. It doesn't mention speech commands.\n\nSo, in this case, since none of the functions can handle \"elevators\" or 15 seconds, I think the output would be that it's invalid and return an action with \"speak\" but explain that no waypoint exists.\n\nWait, looking back at the system rules: if a function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is requested, return actions with error. But in this case, none of the commands involve any functions beyond speak. So maybe I have to fall back to speak and explain why it's not found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"take me\" is part of the speech command but it's unclear if that's allowed here.\n\nI think for now, since none of the commands map to known waypoints, I'll have to output an action with \"speak\", explaining that the waypoint doesn't exist. But looking back at the system's handling: when no waypoint matches and other functions aren't supported, it returns an error. Wait, but in this case, only speak is used.\n\nHmm, perhaps since no commands are mapped beyond speak, I can just output a speak action with an error message like \"The requested command does not contain a known waypoint.\"\n\nBut the system's fuzzy matching for waypoints might not be sufficient because it's looking for exact matches. Maybe \"elevators\" isn't in lowercase, but it could have a slight variation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can process the 15 seconds as part of the speak action, but that doesn't make sense because 15 is just time, not a waypoint name.\n\nSo, maybe I'll output an action with \"speak\" and mention that the required waypoint isn't present. But according to the system's fuzzy matching steps:\n\n1. Normalize: convert both input and waypoint names to lowercase.\n2. Extract tokens: no change here.\n3. Tokenization: split into words (for user input).\n4. Fuzzy match: check if any known waypoints match the tokenized input.\n\nBut in this case, \"elevators\" isn't a known waypoint, nor is 15 seconds. So none of the functions can process it. Therefore, I think the output should be that no valid command was processed because there's no waypoint named elevators or any related waypoint that includes numbers for time.\n\nWait, but perhaps the system can handle \"take me to\" as a function and then include the rest? Not sure how.\n\nIn conclusion, since none of the commands map to known waypoints except speak, which is used for everything, I think it's safe to output a speak action with an error message like \"The requested command does not contain a known waypoint.\"\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the processing:\n\n1. **Take me to the Elevators**: No known waypoint matches, so this function isn't applicable.\n2. **Wait there for 15 seconds**: Again, no known waypoint matches, so this function isn't applicable.\n3. **Find the East Entrance**: No known waypoint for East Entrance.\n\nSince none of these functions match the required waypoints, an error is returned:\n\n**Action: speak**\n  \nThe requested command does not contain a known waypoint.",
