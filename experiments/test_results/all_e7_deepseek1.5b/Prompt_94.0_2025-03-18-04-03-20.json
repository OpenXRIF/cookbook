    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user with their prompt. They want me to process the command \"Robot, proceed to [North Entrance], say 'North Entrance' out loud, and wait for 10 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at what's given. The available waypoints are things like C&D - Coffee Area, D&I - Data Index, etc., with different coordinates. The normalized names would be lowercase versions of these.\n\nThe user mentioned that the waypoint is in a bracket, which suggests it might not be directly a known waypoint but could be part of a command or an unknown location. Since there's no waypoint named \"North Entrance,\" I need to consider if this is allowed.\n\nAccording to the rules, when matching waypoints, any tokens at the beginning are removed unless they're necessary. The input here has \"North Entrance\" in lowercase. I should check if any parts of it match a known waypoint. Looking through the list, none seem to match exactly because all names are specific to certain locations with coordinates.\n\nSo, since there's no known waypoint that matches, the system needs to output an action where it detects this unknown location and then goes to the RoboHub. \n\nI should outline the steps: check if the command includes any known waypoints or actions beyond the allowed list. Since there are none, I'll have the robot speak and wait for 10 minutes as a fallback.\n\nPutting it all together, the response will be an action where the robot detects the unknown location and then navigates to the RoboHub with a waiting period.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This is an invalid command: 'North Entrance' is not recognized.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
