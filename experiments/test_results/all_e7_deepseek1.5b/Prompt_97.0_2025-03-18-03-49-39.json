    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user provided a detailed prompt about matching waypoint names from their input against known waypoints. They also explained some advanced fuzzy matching techniques which I should follow.\n\nThe main task is to write a function or set of instructions that can process different types of commands and output corresponding actions like \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\". The first step is to normalize both the user's input and each known waypoint by converting them to lowercase. That makes sense because the functions are case-insensitive.\n\nNext, I need to remove any extraneous tokens that don't seem relevant. For example, if a token like \"123abc\" appears at the beginning of the input, it can be ignored since it's likely a building code or not part of the address. But wait, in this context, the waypoint names are specific, so maybe it's more about removing irrelevant tokens that don't fit the waypoint names.\n\nOnce both inputs are cleaned, I split them into individual words. For each known waypoint, I check if every token from that name is present in the user's input. If even one word is missing, that waypoint doesn't match. However, if a waypoint has extra tokens like prefixes (like \"C&D\" or \"Room 1427\"), those can be ignored as long as all essential words are present.\n\nIf at least half of the tokens from a waypoint appear in the user's input, it meets the similarity threshold and is considered a match. If multiple waypoints meet this criteria, I select the one with the highest score based on how many tokens they share. The lower the token count, the better because higher overlap means it's more likely to be a genuine match.\n\nNow, considering handling complex commands: the user mentioned processing commands in a left-to-right sequence unless told otherwise. So, for each command part, I have to execute them step by step without jumping around. For example, if someone asks for \"keys\" and then needs to drop them off at a specific place, both actions must be taken sequentially.\n\nAnother point is supported actions. Only the functions available in \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" are allowed. If someone tries to use something beyond that, like calculating the distance, it should return an error message.\n\nEdge cases include unknown waypoints, which return a speak action listing the waypoint doesn't exist. Invalid or ambiguous commands also require an error message with just a speak action. Unsupported actions need their own error messages too.\n\nLooking at the example prompt provided by the user: \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\" The function isn't supported, so it should return a specific message about unsupported actions.\n\nI think I understand how each step fits into the overall process. Now, let me outline the steps the system would take:\n\n1. **Normalize Input:** Convert both user input and waypoint names to lowercase.\n2. **Clean Whys:** Remove tokens that are clearly not part of the address (like building codes or irrelevant prefixes).\n3. **Tokenize:** Split cleaned input into words and split known waypoints into their individual token lists.\n4. **Match Whys:** For each known waypoint, check if all its tokens appear in the user's input. If enough overlap is achieved, it's a match.\n5. **Select Best Match:** Choose the waypoint with the highest similarity score or pick one that has more overlapping tokens for better trust.\n6. **Process Commands:** Depending on how many actions are required and their order, execute them step by step.\n\nI should also consider if there are any nuances I'm missing. For example, when processing commands like \"navigate\" multiple times, each time it should trigger a new navigation session or use the last known waypoint. Similarly, for complex commands with multiple steps, each action must be followed without breaking the flow.\n\nAnother thing to think about is how the function will handle different command lengths and varying input formats. The normalization step ensures that the address parts are normalized, making the matching more accurate regardless of the starting point.\n\nI should also make sure that if the system can't find a waypoint, it returns the \"speak\" action listing the message, as per the edge case guidelines. If all else fails, it falls back to speaking and perhaps providing an error message or another action.\n\nNow, putting this into code structure-wise: the function would take the user's input, normalize it, clean up, tokenize both, match each waypoint, select best matches, then process commands in order if multiple actions are needed. The output is a JSON array of actions with their details.\n\nI think that covers all the bases. Time to outline how I can translate this into code.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
