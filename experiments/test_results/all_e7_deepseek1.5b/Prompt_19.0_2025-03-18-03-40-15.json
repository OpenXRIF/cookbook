    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed prompt about handling a navigation command involving waypoints that aren't immediately obvious. They want me to navigate to the 'unknown zone' first and then proceed to the RoboHub. \n\nHmm, looking at the examples, when the input has unexpected tokens like 'unknown zone', it's treated as an invalid waypoint. But I should make sure my system can handle such cases gracefully.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input command: \"Navigate to Ideas Zone and then go Assembly Room.\" The user might be using a function where words are separated by spaces or other punctuation. So, splitting on whitespace could work, but sometimes commands might have spaces in between.\n\nNext, I'll normalize both the query and each waypoint name to lowercase. That way, case doesn't affect matching. Then, check for extraneous tokens\u2014like if a token starts with letters and contains numbers. If so, it's likely non-essential and should be removed.\n\nTokenizing is next; splitting into individual words. For each waypoint in the list, I'll see if all its tokens are present in the query, allowing some extra tokens like prefixes to pass without issue.\n\nWait, but for commands that involve multiple actions or steps, how does it work? The user mentioned processing them left-to-right, so maybe just follow the order of the words. But the example provided includes navigate, speak, and wait, each handling their own step in the command.\n\nIn this case, since the input has two waypoints, I need to check both. If neither matches, then output an action saying it's invalid. Also, if any function beyond 'navigate', 'speak', or 'wait' is requested, return a speak action with an error message.\n\nI should also consider edge cases: unknown waypoints like 'unknown zone'. Since none exist in the list, I'll return an action pointing that the waypoint doesn't exist. And for unsupported actions, just output 'speak' as per the guidelines.\n\nPutting it all together, the system will process each token of the input command against known waypoints. If neither matches after checking all tokens, it outputs the invalid waypoint message. Otherwise, it executes each action step by step.\n</think>\n\nTo address your query, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Parse the Input Command:**\n   - The user's input is \"Navigate to Ideas Zone and then go Assembly Room.\"\n   \n2. **Normalization:**\n   - Convert both the user's input and known waypoint names to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.\n     - User's query: `navigate to ideas zone and then go assembly room`\n     - Known waypoint list:\n       ```\n       Ideas Zone\n       Assembly Room\n       ```\n\n3. **Extraneous Token Removal:**\n   - Remove tokens that are likely building codes or non-essential identifiers, such as those containing both letters and digits.\n   \n4. **Tokenization:**\n   - Split the normalized user input into individual words:\n     ```\n     navigate to ideas zone and then go assembly room\n     ```\n   - Split each known waypoint name into individual words:\n     ```\n     ideas zone\n     assembly room\n     ```\n\n5. **Similarity Calculation:**\n   - For each known waypoint, assess if every token from the waypoint name appears in the normalized user input.\n   \n6. **Selection and Fallback:**\n   - Since neither \"ideas Zone\" nor \"Assembly Room\" are waypoints listed in your available list, output an action with a message indicating that the waypoint does not exist.\n\n7. **Output Actions:**\n   ```\n   {\n       \"actions\": [\n           {\n               \"action\": \"speak\",\n               \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Final Output\n```\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
