    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this prompt. The user just said, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Hmm, that's pretty straightforward. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided, there are predefined waypoints like \"C and D areas\" or \"RoboHub Entrance.\" But the user is talking about going for a shower, which isn't directly listed as a waypoint. I need to consider if there's any connection between this request and existing waypoints.\n\nI remember that in the problem statement, the example prompts talk about commands involving navigating, speaking, and waiting. The way the functions are called is left-to-right unless specified otherwise. Also, supported edge cases include unknown waypoints needing a speak action with an error message.\n\nWait, but does \"go for a shower\" fall under any of these actions? It doesn't seem to be about navigating buildings or interacting with other people. Maybe it's more of a personal activity or something the system can handle by speaking directly.\n\nLet me check the guidelines again. When handling complex commands, you process in order unless stated otherwise. Since the command isn't about navigating waypoints, speaking, or waiting, perhaps it should just be a speak action. But I'm not entirely sure if \"go for a shower\" is considered a valid function here.\n\nAnother thing to consider: is there any waypoint that could relate to a shower? Looking at the provided waypoints, I don't see anything about personal activities like taking showers or going for a self-care routine. They focus more on specific locations and buildings.\n\nSo, since \"go for a shower\" isn't a known waypoint, it doesn't match any of the available options. Therefore, the system should respond by speaking that an unknown waypoint is requested, just like in some examples given earlier.\n\nI think that's it. The user's request isn't about navigating or interacting with waypoints, so it falls outside the supported functions. Thus, outputting a speak action indicating that the input doesn't exist seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'go for a shower' is not a valid function\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
