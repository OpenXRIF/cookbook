    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where the user can find an Ark reactor. First, I need to look at the available waypoints provided. The main ones are C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Coffee Zone, and others like D and E zones. Hmm, I don't see any waypoint named \"Ark reactor\" or \" Ark reactor\". That means it's not a known waypoint, so according to the guidelines, if there's no such waypoint, I should output an action that says \"speak\" with the message indicating that it doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following all the steps correctly. The user didn't mention any complex commands or ambiguous statements, just a straightforward request for the Ark reactor location. Since it's not available, no additional actions are needed beyond the default speak action. So the response should be clear and straightforward without any extra processing.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to find where the Ark reactor can be located.\n\n1. **Check waypoint availability:** No known waypoint is \"Ark reactor\" or related.\n\n2. **Handle unknown waypoint:** Output a speak action with an error message that confirms it's invalid.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Ark reactor' is not a known waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
