    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to handle the prompt where the user says, \"Let's check out Novelties store, and then head out South Entrance.\" Hmm, okay. So first, I need to break down what this means.\n\nFrom the previous examples, it looks like the system is supposed to parse commands into actions based on known waypoints. The user mentioned a specific waypoint called \"Novelties\" and wants to go to \"South Entrance.\" Wait, but from the available list, I don't see a waypoint named \"South Entrance.\" Let me check that again.\n\nLooking back at the given data: the waypoints are under the section like Microwaves,Microwave, etc. The names of the waypoints are things like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, and others. There's no entry for \"South Entrance\" or \"Novelties.\" Wait, actually, I see that there is a Novelties waypoint but it's under Microwaves, which seems a bit odd. Maybe that's just a typo.\n\nSo the user is asking to go to \"Novelties store,\" and then head out to \"South Entrance.\" But since I don't have a known waypoint for \"South Entrance\" or \"Novelties,\" I need to figure out how to handle this. If neither of these waypoints exist, what should the system do?\n\nLooking back at the rules, if there's no known waypoint that matches the user's request, it should output an action with \"speak\" and the message saying that the waypoint does not exist. But wait, in the prompt from before, when someone asked about Novelties, I think there was a matching waypoint because it was under Microwaves but maybe they were both meant for similar things. Hmm, no, the system seems to treat each waypoint as unique based on their names.\n\nSo if \"South Entrance\" isn't a known waypoint and \"Novelties\" is also not one, then the command is invalid or ambiguous. The supported edge cases mention handling complex commands and avoiding supporting actions beyond \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" or \"wait.\" So in this case, since the user didn't specify a particular action except for navigating to certain places, but there's no known location mentioned.\n\nWait, let me read the prompt again: \"Let's check out Novelties store, and then head out South Entrance.\" It seems like it's asking for an action that goes to both places. But since neither of these waypoints exist in our list, we have to respond by saying the waypoint does not exist. So I should output a speak action with that message.\n\nI think that's how it works. So the system will recognize the query as invalid because there are no known waypoints for \"South Entrance\" or \"Novelties.\" Therefore, the response is an action that the user can't execute because they don't know where to go.\n</think>\n\nThe command contains unknown waypoints and doesn't specify a particular action beyond navigation. Since it's unclear what location should be accessed or desired, no valid action exists.\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'South Entrance' is not a known waypoint.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
