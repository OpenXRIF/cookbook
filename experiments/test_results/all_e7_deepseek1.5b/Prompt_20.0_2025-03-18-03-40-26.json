    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request using the given system prompt. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the user provided a complex command: \"I need freshen up. Take me Shower A, then shower B. Wait 1 minute at shower B, then we go can.\" So, it seems like they want to perform multiple actions in sequence.\n\nLooking back at the system prompt, I remember that commands are processed left-to-right unless stated otherwise. Also, each function (navigate, speak, wait) can be used individually or in combination. If a command has multiple steps, each action should be listed in order.\n\nI check if \"shower A\" is a known waypoint. From the list of waypoint names provided earlier, I don't see a SW shower or shower A mentioned. Similarly, there's no SW shower B either. So, these actions aren't recognized by the system.\n\nSince neither SW shower A nor SW shower B exist as valid waypoints, the first thing to do is handle this error. According to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, we should return an action that says \"speak\" with the message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to make sure that I'm following the right sequence of functions. The user wants shower A first, then shower B, and then wait for 1 minute at shower B before going can. But since these aren't waypoints, each function needs a separate action, even if they're not applicable here.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n- Execute a speak action to inform the user of the error.\n- The input for this action will include an error message stating that \"unknown waypoint\" is not recognized.\n\nI don't need to use any navigate or wait functions since those aren't part of the given command. This ensures that the system adheres to the constraints and provides a clear, consistent response even with unknown commands.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
