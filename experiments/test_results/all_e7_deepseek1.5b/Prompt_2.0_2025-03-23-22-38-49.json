For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\"\n",

    "Experiment ID": 1.0,
    "Prompt ID": 2.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to navigate from the Ideas Clinic to the Assembly Room using the given waypoints. Let me start by recalling all the information provided.\n\nFirst, I know there are several waypoints listed, each with a name, location (as coordinates), and some functions like speak and navigate. The user prompt is asking to navigate to the Ideas Clinic first and then to the Assembly Room.\n\nLet's break this down step by step. First, I need to find where the Ideas Clinic is located. Looking back at the information, there's a waypoint called \"Hot Food Area\" with coordinates (2091, 1157) and functions speak and navigate. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because it's in C&D. Maybe that was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOh, actually, I think the Ideas Zone is at 2468, 35. That makes more sense for a clinic area. So, first step: navigate to (2468, 35). But looking through the list, none of the waypoints are named Ideas Zone or directly at that location. The closest waypoint is \"Shower B\" which is at (791, 610), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe each waypoint has its own coordinates. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the waypoints provided, none of them have x=2468 and y=35. The highest x is 2477 at (2477, 10) in \"C and D areas\". So maybe the location for Ideas Zone isn't listed as a waypoint here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the locations. Let me check each waypoint again:\n\n- RoboHub Entrance: (25, 50)\n- Shower A: (666, 78)\n- Shower B: (791, 610) [and others]\n- C and D areas have various points like (0,0), (39, 4), etc., up to (2477, 10). Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I need to look for \"C and D areas\" as a waypoint name.\n\nWait, the waypoint list seems confusing because it lists individual points but also mentions different zones like C and D areas. Let me clarify:\n\n- The waypoint names are: RoboHub Entrance, shower A, shower B, and then others with different locations.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that \"C and D areas\" is a waypoint name? Wait no, looking at the list again, it's not present. It lists points for each specific location within C and D areas.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Since none of the waypoints are named Ideas Zone or have coordinates (2468, 35), I might need to check if I misread something. Let me try again:\n\nLooking at all the waypoint locations in the list: The highest x-coordinate is 2477 (in C and D areas) and y=10. So perhaps the location for Ideas Zone isn't listed here, which means that the user's prompt might have an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the coordinates. Let me double-check each waypoint:\n\n- RoboHub Entrance: (25, 50)\n- Shower A: (666, 78)\n- Shower B: (791, 610) [and others]\n- C and D areas: points from various locations in different zones.\n\nWait, perhaps \"C and D areas\" is a waypoint name. Looking back at the list:\n\nLooking for \"C and D areas\" as a waypoint name? No, it's not present.\n\nSo, if none of the waypoints are named Ideas Zone or have the coordinates (2468, 35), then navigating to the Ideas Zone isn't possible here. That would mean that the user's request can't be fulfilled based on the available waypoints.\n\nTherefore, I need to consider whether there is a waypoint at (2468, 35). Since it's not listed, and none of the provided waypoints have those coordinates, perhaps the system should return an error message indicating that the Ideas Zone is unknown or invalid.\n\nBut wait, looking again through all the waypoint definitions, none seem to include the location (2468, 35). The highest x in C and D areas is 2477, but that's not the target. So I'm unsure how to proceed without a matching waypoint.\n\nPerhaps I should look for any waypoints with similar coordinates or names that might be near there. However, since none are present, it's likely that the location isn't available in the known waypoints.\n\nIn such cases, when a waypoint is invalid or not listed, the system should respond by indicating that the requested zone is unknown and suggest speaking to someone else if possible. But in this prompt, the user specifically wants to navigate from Ideas Zone to another place. Since I can't find a waypoint for Ideas Zone, perhaps the best action is to acknowledge that no such location exists among the provided waypoints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in how the locations were assigned. For example, perhaps \"C and D areas\" includes (2468, 35) somewhere else in the list I missed, but from what I see, it's not present.\n\nGiven this confusion, if I were to provide a response to the user's query, I would need to inform them that there is no waypoint at (2468, 35), making it impossible to navigate to Ideas Zone as per the provided information. Therefore, the system should indicate that the location isn't available or list an error message.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that the user might have meant a different location, but given the data, this seems unlikely. So, I think it's safe to conclude that without a waypoint at (2468, 35), navigating from there is not possible with the current information.\n</think>\n\nThe requested location of (2468, 35) does not exist among the provided waypoints. Therefore, it is impossible to navigate to Ideas Zone as specified. The system should inform the user that the requested location is not available in the provided list.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere is no waypoint at (2468, 35), making it impossible to navigate to Ideas Zone based on the given data.",
