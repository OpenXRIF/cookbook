For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this command using the given waypoint system. The user has provided a detailed prompt, so let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the command is about moving around different areas, collecting a prepared order, dropping off packages at specific places, and then completing another delivery before returning. It also mentions navigating through various zones like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub, Ideas Clinic, etc., before returning to C&D - Coffee Area again.\n\nLooking back at the waypoint definitions provided, I notice that \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is explicitly listed as a known waypoint with coordinates (100, 100). However, other areas like C&D - Hot Food Area and C&D - Coffee & More are not in the list. So, if someone refers to these other zones without the full names, it might be considered an invalid input.\n\nIn the example prompt given by the user, they mention using a normalized version of the input and checking against each waypoint name. I remember that during normalization, they removed tokens like \"C&,\" which are building codes or non-essential identifiers. So, if someone mentions just \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" without specifying all parts, it's treated as an invalid waypoint.\n\nNow, looking at the waypoint names provided:\n\n1. **C&D - Coffee & More** is present.\n2. **C&D - Coffee Area** is listed.\n3. Other areas like C&D - Hot Food Area or RoboHub are not there.\n\nSo, any mention of \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" would be considered invalid because it's not a known waypoint and lacks additional tokens for better identification. Therefore, when processing the input, if I encounter something like \"C&D - Hot Food Area,\" I should treat it as unknown or invalid.\n\nGiven that, how do I respond? According to the handling of complex commands, if there are multiple interpretations, I need to choose the one with minimal backtracking. In this case, since C&D - Coffee & More exists and is a known waypoint, it's the best match. So, I should process that as a valid waypoint.\n\nThe next part of the command involves moving from C&D - Coffee Area to RoboHub. The input includes an action for navigating to RoboHub with coordinates (25, 50). That seems straightforward. Then another navigation to Ideas Clinic at (25,75). Each time, I check if those waypoints are present.\n\nWait a minute, the user provided specific coordinates in their example prompt. Let me verify:\n\n- C&D - Coffee & More is at (100, 100)\n- RoboHub Entrance is at (25,50)\n- Ideas Clinic is at (25,75)\n\nSo, each of these has a known position. That's good because it means the system can navigate directly to those locations without issues.\n\nPutting it all together: The command requires moving through several waypoints and then backtracking, but each step seems manageable with the known coordinates. There are no undefined or invalid waypoints that would cause errors, so the process should work smoothly.\n\nI also need to consider if there's any ambiguity in the commands beyond navigation. But since they only mention navigate, speak, and wait, I don't have to worry about other functions like speaking again after moving, unless it's part of a loop or another action.\n\nWait, the command includes \"wait\" for 10 seconds when meeting Zach. That might be an issue because if someone specifies waiting for Zach before moving on to the next waypoint, but since all the waypoints are known and have specific coordinates, I don't need to handle that unless Zach's position isn't known.\n\nHmm, maybe the system is designed in a way where each step must occur sequentially without any prior knowledge of other users or variables. So, as long as each waypoint has its own set of instructions, it should be okay.\n\nAlso, after completing all deliveries and returning to C&D - Coffee Area, I need to confirm the next order. Since the system is designed to speak when a command comes in, this would also be handled by the \"speak\" action with an input that confirms or updates the current location, but in this case, it's about confirming the transport of the package.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's example prompt: The last part mentions \"confirm the next order for transport.\" That seems like a need to know where everything is, so perhaps a command like \"navigate to C&D - Coffee & More and confirm\" would be necessary. But since all areas have their own waypoints with coordinates, I can navigate there regardless.\n\nSo, overall, the response should outline each movement step clearly, ensuring that each waypoint's location is accounted for. Since everything seems known, no additional actions are needed beyond what was already planned.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"from\": \"C&D - Coffee & More\",\n        \"to\": \"RoboHub Entrance\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"from\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n        \"to\": \"Ideas Clinic\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"from\": \"Ideas Clinic\", \n        \"to\": \"C&D - Coffee & More\"  # This could be a loop if Zach is known, but since it's not specified, we assume this step must occur\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"from\": \"C&D - Coffee & More\",\n        \"to\": \"(Current Location)\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
