    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at the user prompt they provided: \"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\" My job is to process this using the given fuzzy matching system and handle it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to extract all known waypoints from the input. The relevant waypoint here is \"Assembly Room\" and another one, but in the available list, there's no \"Room\". So, the user mentioned \"Assembly Room,\" which isn't present.\n\nNext, I check if any of the known waypoints match the user's current location or what they're heading to. The user says they're at the Assembly Room, so that makes sense. But since \"Ideas Clinic\" isn't in the available list either, I can't fulfill the request there.\n\nNow, applying the fuzzy matching steps: normalize both inputs and known names. Both are lowercase, which is consistent. No extraneous tokens because none of the waypoints or their descriptions contain letters and digits at the beginning. Tokenization works as well since each is split into words.\n\nFor similarity calculation, I compare \"Assembly Room\" with the waypoint list. The closest is \"Room\" from available waypoints, but it's not present. So, the match isn't sufficient. This means no known waypoint meets the threshold, so I fall back to the actions.\n\nLooking at the supported edge cases, since the request involves an unknown waypoint and a location that also isn't in the list, the appropriate action is \"speak\" with an error message indicating the invalid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
