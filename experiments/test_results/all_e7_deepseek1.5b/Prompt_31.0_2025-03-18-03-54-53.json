    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to help this user with their query. They've provided a detailed prompt about matching waypoints and handling commands, along with examples. Now they're asking for an example where there's no good coffee here and not going to the C&D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what they want in terms of the system's response. From the given prompt, it looks like when the user specifies a waypoint or command, the system should respond by either navigating to that location, speaking instructions, waiting for someone, etc., or output an error if nothing is found.\n\nIn this case, the user is advising not to go to the C&D areas. So I need to check if there's any known waypoint for \"C&D.\" Looking back at the information provided, yes, one of the known waypoints is \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" \n\nSo the system should match the input with this waypoint. It should navigate to that area without the coffee because it's not a good place. Also, since the user explicitly says not to go there, maybe they want a message explaining that.\n\nPutting it together, the response would include navigating to C&D - Coffee Area and then waiting for no time specified. I'll make sure to follow the instructions carefully here.\n</think>\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to handle this request:\n\nThe system should recognize \"C&D\" as a waypoint name and navigate to the corresponding location without coffee because it's not a good spot. Then, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
