    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to process this robot command prompt. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see a bunch of instructions about moving around different zones. The user wants the robot to start at C&D - Hot Food Area, collect something, go to RoboHub, drop off a package, then Ideas Clinic for another delivery, proceed to the Assembly Room, and finally return to C&D - Coffee Area to confirm the next order.\n\nHmm, how do I handle moving around different zones? Each zone is specified by a waypoint name. Maybe the robot can move in sequence based on these waypoints.\n\nI remember there's an availability list with known waypoints like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Hot Food Area, and so on. So, the robot should check if each needed area has a waypoint available.\n\nWait, but I need to process commands in a left-to-right manner unless told otherwise. That means checking if moving from one place to another is possible without considering future instructions first.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Start at C&D - Coffee Area.\n2. Move to C&D - Hot Food Area.\n3. Collect the order here, then drop it off at RoboHub.\n4. From RoboHub, go to Ideas Clinic for another package.\n5. Drop that package there and proceed to the Assembly Room.\n6. Finally, return from the room back to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nI should represent each movement as a command or action. Maybe using a list of actions like navigate, speak, etc., in order.\n\nBut wait, I also have to handle functions beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", and \"wait\". If any function is requested that's not supported, I return an error message with the corresponding action.\n\nSo, first, ensure all necessary waypoints are available. Each step requires a waypoint movement. Let me list them:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - Hot Food Area\n- C&D - Hot Food Area \u2192 RoboHub\n- RoboHub to Ideas Clinic\n- Ideas Clinic \u2192 Assembly Room\n- Assembly Room \u2192 C&D - Coffee Area\n\nI think the robot can handle each movement sequentially. It will check if moving from one area to another is possible, considering their respective waypoints.\n\nAlso, I need to output the actions in order. If any waypoint isn't available, return a speak action with an error message.\n\nAlright, so I'll proceed step by step, checking each necessary move and translating it into the appropriate actions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Collect the prepared order from C&D - Hot Food Area.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Ideas Clinic\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Assembly Room\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\", // Confirm the next order for transport\n            \"input\": {}\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
