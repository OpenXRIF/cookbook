For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 50.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond when someone says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints and their locations. The E5 Entrance is at (1865, 434), and Microwaves are at (2000, 75). So, if someone wants to go from E5 Entrance toMicrowave, they have a direct path.\n\nNow, I remember the rules for matching waypoints. They need both the input and waypoint names normalized to lowercase. That's already done here. Next, extraneous tokens are removed. If there were any, like an acronym or code at the start, we'd discard it. In this case, nothing seems extraneous.\n\nTokenization is next. Both the user's input and waypoints are split into words. For the command \"Travel to E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves,\" I need a navigation function that allows moving from one location to another. The example given in the initial prompt was navigate, which goes from C&D Coffee Area to RoboHub Entrance.\n\nWait, but here it's more than just navigating; it's about traveling through waypoints. So maybe it's not a simple navigate command. It should probably involve multiple steps or additional functions.\n\nThe available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. The task is to construct an action that includes both moving from E5 Entrance to Microwaves and then performing some action. But the initial example only included navigate. Since no other function seems needed beyond navigating, but perhaps it's better to include speak because after arriving at Microwaves, someone might want to say something.\n\nBut I should check if \"speak\" is an option here. The supported edge cases mention that if a function is unsupported (like speaking when not available), return an error. But in this case, the command just involves navigating, so no need for speak or wait beyond navigation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to include both navigate and speak actions because after arriving at Microwaves, you can say something. So the response would be two actions: one to navigate from E5 Entrance toMicrowave and another to say a message when you reach there.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"speak\" is allowed here. The initial examples included both navigation and speak. Let me check the supported edge cases. It says if any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is requested, return an error with \"speak\". But in this case, we're using only navigate. So perhaps it's okay to include speak.\n\nWait, but after arriving at Microwaves, should someone just say they've found them? That might not be necessary unless the user wants more information aboutMicrowave.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just return a single action of navigating and then speaking when you find it. But I'm not sure if that's required.\n\nLooking back at the examples provided, they included both navigate commands followed by speak or wait. So in this case, perhaps it's appropriate to have two actions: one for navigating and another for speaking once at Microwaves.\n\nBut let me check the normalized names again. The user is asking to \"travel to the E5 Entrance\" and then \"find the Microwaves.\" So maybe the steps are navigate from E5 to Microwaves, then find it. But since Microwaves aren't a waypoint in the list, perhaps just navigate there, and then the person wants to check its location or something.\n\nBut according to the rules, the first thing is to match waypoints. So the user's input isn't a known waypoint, but they are giving coordinates for two places: E5 Entrance (1865, 434) and Microwaves (2000, 75). But I don't see a waypoint named \"E5 Entrance\" in the list. Wait, actually, looking back at the initial prompt, there is a waypoint called E5 Entrance with name \"E5 Entrance\" but wait, no\u2014wait, checking the initial data:\n\nAvailable Waypoints include:\n- E5 Entrance (x:1865,y:434)\n\nWait, so the user's input isn't exactly that. They are asking to go from E5 Entrance to Microwaves, which is 2000,75. So if I can navigate to both, then perhaps the action would be navigate to E5 Entrance, then navigate to Microwaves.\n\nBut in terms of functions, since it's not specified that we need to do anything else once at Microwaves, maybe just navigating and speaking when you reach there is sufficient.\n\nWait, but without any waypoint for Microwaves, the system can't actually go there. So perhaps the correct approach is to navigate from E5 Entrance toMicrowave (2000,75) and then speak when you find it or something else. But since Microwaves aren't a named waypoint, maybe the response would just be navigating to those two coordinates.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm following the rules correctly. The user's input is \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" So they're not asking for a specific function beyond navigation. They want to move from one place to another, which are both waypoint locations.\n\nWait, no. Actually, looking back, there is a waypoint called \"E5 Entrance\" with location (1865, 434), and \"Microwaves\" isn't listed as a waypoint, only their coordinates. So the user is asking for navigation from E5 to Microwaves\u2014 but since Microwaves aren't a waypoint, maybe it's not possible unless there's a waypoint named Microwaves.\n\nLooking back at the initial data provided by the user, the waypoints are:\n\n- E5 Entrance (1865, 434)\n- Other waypoints: 2000,75; 2000,-125; -1000,1000; -1000,-25; etc. But I don't see a waypoint called \"Microwaves.\" So perhaps Microwaves aren't intended to be used as waypoints.\n\nTherefore, the user's request is for navigation from E5 Entrance to Microwaves, which isn't possible unless there's a way to find Microwaves through another path or via some other function. But since no waypoint exists for Microwaves, maybe the response should just navigate to both E5 Entrance and Microwaves as separate commands.\n\nBut I think that might not be necessary because the user is asking about navigating from E5 toMicrowave. So perhaps it's better to assume that Microwaves aren't a waypoint and thus can't be reached. Therefore, the action would just involve navigating from E5 Entrance toMicrowave if such a waypoint existed.\n\nBut since the user provided the coordinates for both E5 Entrance and Microwaves, I'm thinking maybe the response should include navigating between those two points. So perhaps the correct function is navigate, which allows moving from one coordinate to another. But looking at the initial example, they used navigate with two waypoints, but in this case, it's from a given coordinate to another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to go from E5 Entrance (1865, 434) and then go to theMicrowave which is at (2000,75). So perhaps it's navigate to both. But since Microwaves aren't a waypoint, I think it's better to ignore that part.\n\nWait, but looking back, I see in the initial data there's a waypoint for -1000, 1000 and so on. Maybe someone can reach a certain point by navigating through those coordinates. But if Microwaves aren't listed as waypoints, perhaps it's not possible to go to them.\n\nSo, given that, maybe the response should just be navigate from E5 Entrance to Microwaves (assuming thatMicrowave is a waypoint) and then whatever action is needed once at that point. But since Microwaves isn't a waypoint, I think the correct approach is to ignore it and focus on navigating between the two given coordinates.\n\nBut in the user's input, they provided both E5 Entrance (1865,434) and Microwaves (2000,75). So perhaps the response should be navigate from E5 Entrance toMicrowave and then speak when you find it. But since Microwaves aren't a waypoint, I think that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to go to both points separately. So navigate to E5 Entrance (1865,434) and then navigate toMicrowave (2000,75). That would be two separate commands, each requiring their own navigation function.\n\nBut in terms of functions available: navigate, speak, wait. Since Microwaves aren't a waypoint, perhaps the response should include navigating between those points as separate actions.\n\nWait, but without a waypoint named Microwaves, I can't go there directly. So maybe it's better to just go from E5 Entrance (1865,434) and then navigate to any other point that is connected via waypoints. For example, 2000,75 or -1000,1000.\n\nSo perhaps the response would be:\n\n- Navigate to E5 Entrance (1865,434)\n- Then navigate from there to 2000,75\n\nBut since Microwaves isn't a waypoint, I think that's it. So the final action is navigating between those two points.\n\nBut in terms of functions, perhaps just navigate to E5 Entrance and then navigate again to the desired point (2000,75). So combining both into one response: navigate twice or combine them into separate commands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user provided both coordinates, so perhaps the response is navigating between those two points. So, perhaps:\n\nNavigate from E5 Entrance (1865, 434) to Microwaves (2000,75)\n\nBut since Microwaves aren't a waypoint, that's not possible. Therefore, maybe it's better to ignore Microwaves and focus on navigating between the two given coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the response is just:\n\nNavigate from E5 Entrance (1865, 434) to 2000,75\n\nBut since Microwaves aren't a waypoint, I think that's the way to go. Therefore, in the final answer, the user would be guided to navigate between those two coordinates.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the response is just a single \"Navigate\" action from E5 Entrance to 2000,75.\n</think>\n\nThe role requires navigating between specific coordinates. The correct way is:\n\n**Navigate from E5 Entrance (1865,434) to 2000,75**\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Navigate from E5 Entrance (1865, 434) to 2000, 75}}",
