    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The task is to create an action list using the provided functions and waypoints.\n\nFirst, let's break down the prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" It seems like the user wants a command that navigates them to a specific waypoint called \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nLooking at the available actions, navigate is one of them. So, the first thing I should do is check if there's a waypoint named \"E7 silent study\" in the list provided.\n\nChecking through each waypoint, I see that none of them have an action like navigating to a specific room or location. They are all predefined commands or places without any dynamic navigation capability.\n\nSince there's no waypoint with the name \"E7 silent study,\" I can't find a way for the system to respond directly. The options are either to speak and inform that it doesn't exist or output an error message requesting a valid waypoint.\n\nI should follow the instructions given, which say if a known waypoint isn't found, output an action with \"speak\" and the input that mentions the unknown waypoint does not exist. That seems appropriate because it's necessary for the system to recognize when there's no suitable option available.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'll structure the response by sending a speak action to inform about the unavailable waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7 silent study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
