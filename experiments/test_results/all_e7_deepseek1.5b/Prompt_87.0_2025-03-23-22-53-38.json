For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\"\n",

    "Experiment ID": 13.0,
    "Prompt ID": 87.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the prompt \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\" based on the given guidelines. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the normalization step, both the user's input and each waypoint name should be converted to lowercase. The input here is a command with words like \"Robot\" and \"Wait,\" so in lowercase it would be \"robot, go to temporary booth and wait for 30 minutes.\"\n\nNext, I have to process this command according to the steps provided. The command mentions multiple actions: going to a location and waiting time. Since each action is performed sequentially, I should check if there are waypoint names that match these commands.\n\nI remember from the guidelines that when matching waypoints, I need to check if all tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input, or at least a high percentage (80% or more) of them. Let's see:\n\nThe waypoints given include shower B, assembly room, etc., but not \"go to\" or other commands like navigate, speak, wait. So I need to handle this command as a series of actions.\n\nBreaking down the prompt: \"Robot\" is likely trying to navigate to something and then go to a booth. Since there's no waypoint named \"navigate,\" I might have to select other waypoints that can be navigated or served.\n\nWait, in the user's example commands, they had specific waypoints like Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, etc., where each has a known location. So perhaps for this prompt, since it's about going and waiting, I need to check if there are waypoints related to locations near where Robot is being directed.\n\nLooking at the way points:\n\n- Shower B: Clean, Wash, 1919\n- Assembly Room: Workspace, Machines, Repair, Work, Build, Manufacture, Assemble, 1401\n- Other commands like navigating, etc., might not have waypoints that can be directly matched to go to a location.\n\nBut the prompt mentions going \"to Temporary Booth\" and then \"wait for 30 minutes.\" So perhaps I need to find a waypoint named \" permanently wait,\" but there isn't one. Alternatively, maybe navigate to a booth where Robot can be picked up.\n\nWait, the user's example commands included specific places like Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic, so maybe I should look for way points that correspond to locations near where these actions are happening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since \"go\" and \"wait\" aren't waypoints themselves, but they imply going to a certain location. So if there's no waypoint named \"navigate,\" I have to select other nearby waypoints or check if any are related.\n\nWait, in the given way points, shower B is at 827 E, which might be near where Robot would go. Maybe it's better to proceed without selecting a known waypoint and instead handle these actions step by step, possibly using existing way points.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n1. Normalize the input: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes\" becomes \"robot, go to temporary booth and wait for 30.\"\n\n2. Check each waypoint's name in lowercase to see if it contains all tokens of the query or a high percentage.\n\n- Token list from query: [\"robot\", \"go\", \"to\", \"temporary\", \"booth\", \"wait\", \"for\", \"30\"]\n\n- Waypoints:\n\n   - shower b: [827, E] \u2192 does not match\n   - assembly room: [1865, 434] \u2192 no\n   - shower b is a waypoint but doesn't include \"go\" or \"to\"\n   So none of the known waypoints have all tokens in the query.\n\n3. Since no waypoint matches and the actions require navigating and waiting, I might need to select the closest known locations.\n\nBut since there are no waypoints named with specific directions or distances, perhaps it's better to default to a speak action acknowledging the request without selecting any waypoints. This aligns with the guidelines because if none of the predefined actions (navigate, speak) match, and the user is making an unsupported command, I should respond by saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nWait, looking back at the edge cases: If a waypoint is unknown or ambiguous, return a speak action with the error. But in this case, the query isn't about a known waypoint but rather executing specific actions.\n\nHmm, perhaps in this scenario, since no waypoints are found and it's an unsupported command (as it mentions navigate and wait without way points), I should respond by speaking that there's no such waypoint and the request is invalid. So output would be:\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but the original query uses \"go\" which isn't a waypoint. Maybe I should check if there are way points named after other words. But since none exist, it's best to default.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps navigate to \"permanently wait,\" but there is no such word, so that would also be invalid.\n\nTherefore, the final response would be acknowledging the request and stating that a valid waypoint isn't available.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
