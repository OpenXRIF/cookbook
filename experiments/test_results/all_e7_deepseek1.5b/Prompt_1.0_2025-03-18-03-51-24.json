    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this prompt that says, \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples given, it seems like when someone wants to go to a specific location, they input the waypoint names. The system checks if these waypoints exist and uses them as actions with specific inputs in the form of coordinates or just names depending on their type.\n\nIn this case, the user is asking two things: first, go to the North Entrance, and second, then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance. So I think each part should be treated separately.\n\nI remember that when a user specifies multiple waypoints separated by \"and\" or other related terms, the system might process them together, but here it's just two separate requests: going to one entrance and then another. \n\nLooking at the known waypoint names in the available list, I see \"North Entrance,\" \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" etc., but none of these seem directly related to this request. So I need to check if any of the known waypoints match either part.\n\nFor the first part, \"North Entrance\" is one of the waypoint names available. The second part mentions \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" which also exists in the list. \n\nWait, does the system recognize that the user might be using these as separate actions or a combination? Since the commands are separate and don't mention \"and\" except between the two requests, I think each should be treated individually.\n\nI'll need to find if either of these waypoints exactly matches what the user is asking. Looking at the list:\n\n- \"North Entrance\" has a name with x: 100 and y: 50.\n- \"C&D - Main Entrance\" has a name with x: 25, y: 75.\n\nBut the first part of the prompt asks to go directly to \"North Entrance,\" not in relation to \"C&D.\" So I'll process each as an action.\n\nNow, since there are two waypoints, both are available. I need to check if they meet the similarity threshold for matching the commands given. But since these are separate waypoints, and assuming each is unique, they might each individually match.\n\nTherefore, the system should output actions for \"navigate\" to go to \"North Entrance\" with input (100,50) and another action for \"navigate\" to proceed to \"C&D - Main Entrance\" with input (25,75).\n\nI think that's it. Both commands are separate, so two navigate actions should be returned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Main Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
