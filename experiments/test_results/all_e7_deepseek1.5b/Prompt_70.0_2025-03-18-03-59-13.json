    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user says, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Hmm, that's not exactly a command or an instruction about navigating, speaking, or waiting. It sounds more like a personal statement or something they're doing on their own. \n\nLooking at the examples provided, I see cases where the response is either to speak and provide specific actions, navigate to certain locations, or wait for someone. In these scenarios, each action has clear input requirements.\n\nIn this case, the user isn't specifying any waypoints or directions. They just want a shower in an unknown area. That doesn't fit into the predefined structures of the examples. So, I think the best response is to inform them that there are no known waypoints that match their request and suggest speaking instead.\n\nI should structure it like one of those example responses: \"speak\" with an input message explaining why it's not applicable. That way, they get a clear action but also understand that this isn't providing any specific direction or waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
