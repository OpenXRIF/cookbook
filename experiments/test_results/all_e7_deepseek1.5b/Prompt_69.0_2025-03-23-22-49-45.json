For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\"\n",

    "Prompt ID": 69.0,
    "Prompt": "\"I could really go for a shower.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's instruction of going for a shower. Let me start by breaking down what they're asking.\n\nFirst, the prompt says, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Hmm, that sounds like a simple request for someone to wash something or perform an action related to taking a shower. But I need to be careful because it's not very specific.\n\nLooking back at the examples and guidelines provided earlier, I see that when matching waypoint names, there are certain rules. The goal is to normalize both the user's input and each known waypoint name by converting them to lowercase. So, \"go for a shower\" becomes \"GO FOR A SHOWER,\" and if there were any non-essential parts like prefixes or suffixes, they would be removed.\n\nNext, the available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. Since the user is asking to go for a shower, which is an action that doesn't require navigation, I don't think navigating should be triggered here.\n\nNow, checking if there's any known waypoint named \"SHOWER\" or related. Scanning through the provided waypoints, I don't see one named \" showers.\" It seems like there's no known waypoint for a shower. So, the system needs to detect that and respond appropriately.\n\nThe handling of complex commands is important here because the user wants multiple actions: navigating, speaking, waiting, and then going to the RoboHub. But wait, in this case, it's just going for a shower, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.\n\nI should follow the steps outlined in the guidelines. First, normalize both the input and known waypoints to lowercase. The input is \"go for a shower,\" which becomes \"GO FOR A SHOWER.\" Now, checking if any known waypoint matches \"SHOWER\" or parts of it. If none do, then I need to see if there's an action that can handle this request.\n\nLooking at the supported actions, navigate, speak, and wait are the options. Since the user is asking for a shower, which isn't a standard function, but perhaps the speaking action should be used to ask someone to help them go through the shower. Then, after getting the help, they might need to navigate or go to another place.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The example prompt provided in the guidelines shows that when there's ambiguity, an error message is returned if it's invalid. But since \"SHOWER\" isn't a known waypoint and the user just wants to go for a shower, perhaps the appropriate action is to speak and ask for help or guidance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system should recognize that the request can be fulfilled through actions like navigating to a specific room (Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic) after asking for assistance. But since it's a simple shower, perhaps just speaking is enough, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI think the best approach is to first check if there's an action that directly corresponds to the request without needing further navigation or speaking. Since \"go for a shower\" isn't a known function, perhaps the system should ask for assistance or guide them through the process of getting a shower done.\n\nBut wait, in the guidelines, when multiple waypoints are possible, they should be selected based on similarity. However, since there's no waypoint named SHOWER, maybe it's better to go ahead with the speak action and inform the user that they need to take specific steps or ask for help.\n\nI might also consider if \"go\" is an available action. Checking the list of known actions, yes, there are speak, navigate, wait, etc., but not go. So, perhaps the system should first get assistance or guide them through a process involving going and speaking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the command can be broken down into steps: go to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic (navigate), then ask someone to help with showering (speak). But without knowing if that's a waypoint, it might not work.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. I think the user wants to perform a simple action of going for a shower, so perhaps the appropriate action is \"speak\" and ask them how to go there. But since there's no waypoint named SHOWER, maybe they need to navigate or get assistance first.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, when the command involved multiple waypoints, they were handled step by step. So in this case, maybe the process is: go to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic (navigate), then ask for help with showering (speak), and wait for that person.\n\nBut since I don't have a waypoint named SHOWER or related, I'm not sure if \"speak\" can be used without knowing who to ask. It might result in an error message because there's no predefined way to handle this specific action.\n\nSo, perhaps the appropriate response is to speak and inform them that they need assistance navigating to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic after getting help with showering. But since I don't have a waypoint for that, maybe it's better to just go ahead with the available actions first: navigate to the room (navigate), then ask for help (speak).\n\nWait, but in the guidelines, if there are multiple possible functions, they should be considered based on similarity. However, in this case, I don't see a waypoint named SHOWER or related, so maybe it's best to just go ahead with navigate and speak, even though I might not know all the details.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system can recognize that the command is for getting assistance, which isn't a predefined function, and thus needs to be handled through specific actions. But since I don't have those functions defined in my knowledge base, it's safer to proceed with what I can handle.\n\nI think the best approach is to go step by step: navigate to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic (navigate), then ask for help (speak). Even though I might not know all the details of how that person will be guided or how they'll assist, it's the logical next steps. So, perhaps in this case, I should respond with a speak action and guide them through navigating to the room.\n\nWait, but if there's no waypoint for getting help, maybe the system can't handle it directly. Perhaps the appropriate response is to go step by step using the known actions: navigate first to the specific room (Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic), then ask someone to assist with showering.\n\nBut again, without knowing how that person will be guided or assisted, I might end up with an error message because there's no predefined function for this action. So, maybe the system should just go ahead and guide them through the process of navigating and getting assistance, even if it doesn't have a specific waypoint named SHOWER.\n\nIn summary, to respond to \"I could really go for a shower,\" I think the appropriate response is to navigate to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic (navigate) and then ask for help (speak). This way, I'm following the known actions but using them in sequence. Even though there's no waypoint specifically named SHOWER or related, this approach makes logical sense within the given guidelines.\n\nI might also consider that if I don't have a predefined action for getting assistance, perhaps I should inform the user that they need to take specific steps involving navigation and interaction with others, but without more defined functions, it might not be feasible. Therefore, proceeding step by step seems like the way to go.\n\nAlright, so putting it all together, my response would involve navigating to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic (navigate) first and then asking for help (speak). Even though there's no specific waypoint for showering, this approach follows the logical sequence of navigation and interaction.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's request of \"I could really go for a shower,\" I would proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Navigate to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic**: Use the \"navigate\" action to get directed to the specified room.\n2. **Ask for Help**: Once in the room, use the \"speak\" action to guide them on how to handle their shower.\n\nThis approach follows the logical sequence of navigation and interaction, even though there's no predefined function for getting assistance or handling this specific action.",
