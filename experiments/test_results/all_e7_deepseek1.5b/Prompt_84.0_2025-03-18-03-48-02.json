    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's prompt. The prompt says, \"Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes.\" First, I need to break down what the user is asking.\n\nThey mention a robot moving and waiting, which immediately makes me think of navigation. The waypoint names are given as options like navigate, speak, or wait. So the task seems straightforward\u2014navigate to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, there's a \"navigate\" option where I can specify the location. The user wants to go to that place, so I should include both the path and the waiting time in the input. The input field should have a waypoint name followed by optional parameters like location and duration.\n\nI remember from the previous examples that when specifying waypoints, we usually enter them as \"navigate [name]\" if it's just navigating. But since the user also wants to wait for 10 minutes, I need to add more details in the input field. So the input should be something like \"navigate C&D - Main Entrance 10\".\n\nWait, let me double-check. The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. The output should have actions based on these functions. Since the user is asking for a navigation command followed by waiting, I'll generate two actions: one for navigate with the location, and another for wait.\n\nPutting it all together, the input field will be \"navigate C&D - Main Entrance 10\". That should satisfy the user's request to move there and wait. No other waypoint functions are needed here because it's a clear navigation command with a specified duration.\n</think>\n\nThe task is about navigating to a specific location and waiting for a specified amount of time.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:** The user wants to navigate to \"C&D - Main Entrance\" and wait for 10 minutes.\n\n2. **Identify the Waypoint Function Needed:** The required action is \"navigate\", as it involves moving to a specific location.\n\n3. **Specify the waypoint Name:** The desired location is \"C&D - Main Entrance\".\n\n4. **Include Required Parameters:** In the navigation input field, specify both the waypoint name and the time waited: `navigate C&D - Main Entrance 10`.\n\n5. **Generate Action:** Since it's a clear instruction to navigate and wait, only one action with \"navigate\" is needed.\n\n**Final Input:**  \nnavigate C&D - Main Entrance 10",
