    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me figure out how to handle this query. The user has given a list of waypoints with their descriptions and available functions like navigate, speak, and wait. They also have some examples of prompts and responses.\n\nThe specific prompt the user provided is: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\" I need to determine what kind of action this request would take based on the given guidelines.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of known waypoint names, they all seem like waypoints with a name followed by coordinates. For example, \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is a waypoint where C&D is the name and 100, 100 are the x and y coordinates. Similarly, \"Microwaves\" has a specific path described in its name.\n\nNow, the user's prompt mentions \"Robot,\" which might imply they want a robot to perform an action. The next part is about moving to a temporary booth and waiting for 30 minutes. So, I need to see if this is a valid waypoint or not.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints provided, none seem to mention \"Robot\" as part of their names. All examples are specific areas within the building with coordinates. The prompt here doesn't reference any known waypoint, so it's unclear if it exists in the available list.\n\nI need to consider the advanced fuzzy matching steps they mentioned. First, normalize both the input and each waypoint by converting to lowercase. Then, remove extraneous tokens like those containing letters and digits at the beginning.\n\nNext, tokenization is done by splitting into individual words. The user's prompt doesn't present a waypoint name but rather an action request. So, I need to assess if this can be matched against any known waypoint names.\n\nSince \"Robot\" isn't part of any waypoint's description or coordinates, none of the waypoints match. According to the guidelines, if no known waypoint matches, the system should output actions with the message \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nHowever, the prompt includes moving to a temporary booth and waiting for 30 minutes. That sounds like it might be related to navigating a specific area. Maybe there's an unknown waypoint that represents that action? But looking at the provided list, I don't see a waypoint named \"Moving to Temporary Booth\" or anything similar.\n\nTherefore, without any matching waypoint name, the system should respond by indicating that the request doesn't exist in the known list. The actions would include a speak command stating that it's an invalid request and possibly another action if applicable, but since the response is about moving to a booth and waiting, which isn't a waypoint, maybe just speaking about its absence.\n\nSo, I think the appropriate action is to output an \"action\" with \"speak\" and the message as specified. That way, the user knows that their request doesn't exist in the system's known waypoints.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: Robot does not recognize or navigate to Temporary Booth.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
