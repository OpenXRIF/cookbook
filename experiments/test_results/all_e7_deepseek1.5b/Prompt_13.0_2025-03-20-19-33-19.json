For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Take my to the HubRobo\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt \"Take my to the HubRobo\". First, I'll analyze the problem step by step.\n\nThe task involves processing commands, handling unknown waypoints, and generating appropriate actions. Let me go through the guidelines again to understand what needs to be done.\n\n1. **Normalization**: Both the input and known waypoint names should be converted to lowercase.\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal**: Remove tokens that are building codes or appear at the beginning of the input.\n3. **Tokenization**: Split the cleaned inputs into individual words.\n4. **Similarity Calculation**: Check if each waypoint's name contains all necessary parts of the user's command, allowing for some extra tokens.\n\nThe user's prompt is \"Take my to the HubRobo\". Let me break this down into components: \"take\", \"my\", \"to\", \"the\", and \"hubro\". I'm not sure what \"HubRoB\" refers to, so I'll assume it's a waypoint name.\n\nLooking at the known waypoints, none seem to match \"HubRoB\". So, my first thought is that this might be an unknown waypoint. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint isn't found, we should output an action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm following all steps correctly. The user's prompt doesn't explicitly mention any specific functions beyond navigation and speaking. So, perhaps it's more about navigating to a location.\n\nBut without knowing \"HubRoB\", I can't generate a specific action. Since the waypoint isn't recognized, the response should reflect that there's no known way to reach \"HubRoB\".\n\nAlso, considering the example where an unknown waypoint is returned as just a speak action with the message, this seems appropriate here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"HubRoB\" isn't in our list of waypoints, I'll output an action suggesting that the command can't be met because the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user's prompt is incomplete and not properly formatted. However, based on the guidelines provided, when a known waypoint or function isn't recognized, the response should indicate that it doesn't exist.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Normalization**: The input \"Take my to the HubRoB\" becomes lowercase \"take my to hubrob\".\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal**: No extraneous tokens are present as all words are essential and appear at the beginning of the command.\n\n3. **Tokenization**: Splitting into individual tokens gives [\"take\", \"my\", \"to\", \"the\", \"hubro\"].\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation**: Comparing each token to known waypoint names, none match \"hubro\".\n\n5. **Fallback Actions**: Since no known waypoint exists for \"hubro\", the response should indicate that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'HubRoB' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
