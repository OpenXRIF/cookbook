    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this problem. The user wants me to process a query that involves traveling to an entrance and finding microwaves. I need to figure out how to match these commands against the known waypoints.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, there are places like E5 Entrance, Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic, RoboHub, C&D - Coffee Area, and others. The query mentions \"travel to\" an entrance, which could be E5 or RoboHub, since both start with 'E' or 'R'. But wait, the user specifically mentioned finding microwaves, which is a different waypoint.\n\nSo, I need to check if any known waypoint matches \"microwaves\". Scanning through, none of the waypoints have a 'M' or 'W', so this seems like an invalid command. That means there's no matching waypoint, and according to the guidelines, I should respond with an action that says the request is impossible.\n\nI remember the rules say if no known waypoint meets the criteria, output actions with \"speak\" and the message about the waypoint not existing. So my response should be straightforward: speak and include the error message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
