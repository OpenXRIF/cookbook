    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the prompt \"Go North Entrance and then proceed to C&D - Main Entrance.\" The user provided some details about matching waypoint names using fuzzy logic. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a user asks for specific locations or places, they might not have exact words but can describe them in text. So, the idea is to look up each location as a waypoint and see if it's recognized. The functions available are Navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, there are several options like \"North Entrance,\" \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" etc., but I don't have their exact names in the given data. However, in general, when someone says they want to go north entrance, it's likely a specific place, maybe a building or an area.\n\nNow, applying the fuzzy matching steps: normalize both user input and waypoint names to lowercase. The normalized user query is \"Go North Entrance and then proceed to C&D - Main Entrance.\" That seems like multiple instructions that need to be converted into tokens for comparison with each known waypoint name.\n\nNext, I need to extract tokens from the query. Let's see, \"Go\" is a token, \"North Entrance\" as another, \"and\" again, \"then,\" \"proceed\" and \"to,\" \"C&D - Main Entrance.\" So the list of tokens would be: [\"go\", \"north\", \"entrance\", \"and\", \"then\", \"proceed\", \"to\", \"cand\", \"main\", \"entrance\"].\n\nNow, for each waypoint name I might have (but since it's not provided, maybe a general approach), split the known names into tokens. For example, if there's a waypoint named \"North Entrance,\" its tokens would be [\"north\", \"entrance\"]. Similarly, for another waypoint like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" tokens would be [\"cand\", \"coffee\", \"area\"].\n\nComparing each token from the user input to the known waypoints:\n\n1. \"go\" vs any waypoint names: Probably not a relevant term.\n2. \"north\": Check if there's a waypoint called \"North Entrance.\" If yes, match.\n3. \"entrance\": Again, see if there are multiple entries for different entrances, maybe multiple north entrances or other ones.\n4. \"and\": Not necessarily a known place, so ignore.\n5. \"then\": Doesn't seem relevant to a location name.\n6. \"proceed\": Maybe part of the path, but not directly a waypoint token.\n7. \"to\": Again, doesn't form a recognizable place on its own.\n8. \"cand\": If there's a waypoint named \"C&D,\" then it might match.\n9. \"main\": Check if there's a waypoint called \"C&D - Main Entrance.\"\n10. \"entrance\": Same as point 3.\n\nSo, the key tokens are: north, entrance, cand, main. I need to see which of these appear in any known waypoint names. Let's imagine that there might be two waypoints with similar names or different ones. But without knowing their exact names, it's hard, but according to the steps, we have to consider each way.\n\nIf none of the waypoints have \"north,\" then move on. If they do, check if other tokens like \"entrance\" and \"cand\" are present in multiple ways because you can include extra non-essential words without losing a match.\n\nWait, but when matching, for each waypoint name, it's about presence of all its tokens. So even with additional tokens, as long as all the relevant ones are there, it's considered a match.\n\nSo if \"North Entrance\" is one of the known names and includes \"north,\" that would make it a match. If not, maybe check other waypoints.\n\nBut since I don't have the exact names, but assuming for example that two waypoint names exist with different entrances: say, \"North Entrance A\" and \"South Entrance B.\" Then both could be matches if they include \"north\" or \"south,\" etc.\n\nWait, in the initial prompt, the user is asking to go North Entrance. If there are multiple entries for different parts of the same entrance or separate ones, that's another consideration.\n\nIn this case, since it's just \"North Entrance\" and \"C&D - Main Entrance,\" if those names correspond to known waypoints with certain tokens, then each would match based on their own token sets.\n\nSo, perhaps both are in the list. But without knowing, we can proceed under the assumption that either one or both of them are present as waypoint names.\n\nOnce confirmed that a waypoint meets the similarity criteria (like having all tokens covered), select the action and input accordingly.\n\nIn this case, since \"C&D - Coffee Area\" might have \"cand,\" which is part of the user's request, it would match. Similarly, another waypoint with \"north\" could also be used.\n\nBut since I don't know for sure, perhaps checking each one:\n\nIf there are two waypoints named \"North Entrance A\" and \"South Entrance B.\" Then both have tokens including \"north,\" so that's a strong case.\n\nAlternatively, if \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is present as another waypoint with \"cand,\" then that would also match the user's request for \"proceed to C&D.\"\n\nIn any case, once the matching waypoints are confirmed, the user can proceed with the action: Go to [North Entrance A] and then to [C&D - Coffee Area].\n\nWait, but in the prompt, it's \"Go North Entrance\" and \"to C&D - Main Entrance.\" So if there is a waypoint named \"Main Entrance,\" that would be another token. But without knowing, perhaps only certain waypoints are considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two waypoints: one with \"North Entrance A\" (tokens north, entrance, cand) and another with \"C&D - Coffee Area\" (tokens cand, coffee, area). Both include the relevant tokens for the user's request.\n\nSo, if both are present, then it's a match. If only one, that would also be considered a match because you can include extra words.\n\nBut in this case, since the user specifically mentions \"North Entrance,\" and not necessarily another name, perhaps they have to pick an entrance named North or proceed with another method.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to use fuzzy logic, so it's about matching based on tokens. If \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is a waypoint that has \"cand,\" which is part of the user query, then even if there are extra words like \"entrance\" and \"proceed,\" as long as all needed tokens are present, it's considered a match.\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Because for each token, you have to have exact words. So for \"north,\" it might be part of another waypoint name or an actual place name that doesn't correspond exactly to the query.\n\nThis is getting complicated without knowing the exact names. Maybe I should suggest checking if any known waypoints include all relevant tokens from the user's request.\n\nIf both \"North Entrance\" and \"C&D - Coffee Area\" are present as waypoint names, then it would be a match because they have the necessary tokens.\n\nAlternatively, if \"C&D - Main Entrance\" is a separate waypoint that includes \"cand,\" which is in the query, that would also work.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there might be multiple ways to respond based on known waypoints that include the relevant tokens from the user's request.\n</think>\n\nBased on the fuzzy logic approach and considering potential known waypoint names, here's how you can respond:\n\n**Response:**\n\n\"Go to [Name of the North Entrance] or proceed further to [C&D - Coffee Area].\"\n\nExplanation: Based on fuzzy matching, the waypoints \"North Entrance,\" \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" and any other relevant waypoint include tokens that match your request.
