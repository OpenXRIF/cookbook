    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They asked for help navigating to Ideas Clinic and then going to the Assembly Room. First, I should check if there are any known waypoints that match this request.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I don't see one explicitly named \"ideas clinic\" or \"assembly room.\" The closest is \"speak,\" which just says speak without any location details. So, it's likely an unknown waypoint.\n\nSince I can't find a matching waypoint, according to the guidelines, if no known waypoint matches, I should output an action where the input says \"This waypoint does not exist\" and specify that actions are limited to speak.\n\nI also need to make sure there are no additional functions beyond navigate, speak, or wait. Since the user didn't ask for navigation, just asking, it fits within the allowed functions.\n\nSo, my response should include this action with the input as specified without any other options.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
