    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this command where the user says, \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the rules provided, when matching waypoints, they use normalized names in lowercase, remove extraneous tokens like building codes, split into words, and check for similarity. They also have some advanced fuzzy matching where if a lot of tokens match, even with extra ones before or after, it's considered a hit.\n\nIn this case, the user is asking to go to two different waypoints: North Entrance and then C&D - Main Entrance. So I need to see if both these waypoints exist in the known list.\n\nI remember from the given data that there are entries for \"North Entrance\" and \"C&D - Main Entrance.\" Let me check:\n\nLooking at the known waypoints, I don't see a direct match for \"C&D - Main Entrance.\" Wait, maybe it's just called \"C&D - Coffee Area\"? Hmm, no. Or perhaps it's under another name. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back, the waypoint names are listed as:\n\n- North Entrance\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- RoboHub Entrance\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n\nOh, I see now. The user is asking for \"C&D - Main Entrance.\" Maybe that's a typo or an oversight. It might be intended to point out the C&D building in general.\n\nBut regardless, based on the given data, only \"North Entrance\" and \"RoboHub Entrance\" are present. So \"C&D - Main Entrance\" isn't listed. Therefore, neither of the waypoints matches exactly.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user is using a different name that's not mentioned here. But according to the provided list, it seems like there are only specific names given. So if both waypoints don't exist, then we have to handle this as an unknown waypoint scenario.\n\nBut in the advanced fuzzy matching process, each known waypoint is checked. Since neither \"C&D - Main Entrance\" nor any other waypoint matches exactly, but perhaps there's a partial match. For example, if \"C&D - Main Entrance\" was supposed to be matched with \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" maybe that would have been included. But as it stands, both are missing.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the known waypoints:\n\n1. North Entrance\n2. C&D - Coffee Area (which might be the intended place after)\n3. RoboHub Entrance\n4. Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\n\nSo if \"C&D - Main Entrance\" isn't in the list, then it's considered an unknown waypoint.\n\nBut wait, in the example I saw earlier, when the user asked for an invalid command like \"unknown zone,\" they got a message saying it doesn't exist. So perhaps this is similar.\n\nIn our case, since both waypoints are missing, the action should be to speak and state that it does not exist. But let me make sure there's no other waypoint that matches partially or has some tokens overlapping.\n\nFor instance, if \"C&D - Main Entrance\" was intended as a misspelling of \"Coffee Area,\" but in the known list, there's only one \"Coffee Area.\" Or maybe the user meant another place entirely. But based on the data, it's not present.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to output that the unknown waypoint does not exist and speak with that message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'C&D - Main Entrance' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
