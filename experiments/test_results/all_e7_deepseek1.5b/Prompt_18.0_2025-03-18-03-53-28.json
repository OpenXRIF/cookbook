    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to process their query about navigating from the North Entrance to the C&D - Main Entrance. First, I need to check if these waypoints are available.\n\nI remember that the North Entrance is listed as \"go north entrance\" with coordinates (0.0, 50). And the C&D - Main Entrance has the waypoint name, which matches perfectly. So, both locations exist in my known list.\n\nSince the user provided exact commands without any ambiguity, I don't need to worry about multiple interpretations or backtracking. It's a straightforward navigation request.\n\nI should output actions as \"navigate\" with the respective coordinates for each location. That should cover everything they asked for.\n</think>\n\n{\"actions\": [\n    {\n        \"action\": \"navigate\",\n        \"input\": {\n            \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n            \"x\": 0.0,\n            \"y\": 50\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"navigate\",\n        \"input\": {\n            \"name\": \"C&D - Main Entrance\",\n            \"x\": 100,\n            \"y\": 60\n        }\n    }\n]}",
