    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed prompt about handling advanced fuzzy matching for waypoints and specific command processing. I need to extract the relevant information from the given data.\n\nFirst, looking at the role section, it seems the system is designed to navigate, speak, and wait based on certain rules. The available functions are Navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nNow, focusing on the user prompt: \"Robot, proceed to Elevators and say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation.\" It's a bit unclear, but I think it means the robot should go to the Elevator zone and then tell someone about it. \n\nThe available waypoints include places like C&D Coffee Area, Coffee & Tea Zone, etc., but the user isn't directly asking for a waypoint. Instead, they're instructing the robot to move there. So I need to translate this into actions.\n\nI'll check if any waypoint matches 'Elevators'. Scanning through, I don't see an obvious match for 'Elevators' or 'Elevator'. Since it's not in the known waypoints, the system should respond that the action is to speak and mention the invalid request.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should instruct the robot to navigate to Elevator Zone, which isn't a waypoint but a command. I'll structure this as a speak action with the input explaining the issue.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Elevators' is not a valid waypoint or function.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
