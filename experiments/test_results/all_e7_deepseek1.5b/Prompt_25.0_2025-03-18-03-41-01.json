    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the user's query step by step. They provided a prompt asking for a way to clean up by taking two showers and waiting before going out. The first thing I notice is that the prompt includes multiple actions: taking shower A, shower B, waiting, and then moving on. \n\nLooking at the available functions, navigate, speak, and wait are all valid. However, in this case, the user wants to perform several actions sequentially. Since each action can be done with a specific function, I should check if any waypoint names match these commands.\n\nI don't see any waypoints that directly correspond to taking a shower or waiting, so they won't match the 'speak' function. Similarly, there are no waypoints for navigating through a room or using a door. \n\nThe problem here is that the user's request requires multiple actions beyond what the system supports. Each action needs a corresponding waypoint name. Without those names, we can't process each step with the available functions.\n\nI should inform the user that they've provided an invalid command because it includes actions like shower A and B without corresponding waypoints. The correct approach would be to validate the request against the known waypoints before processing further.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
