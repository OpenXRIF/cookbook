    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.\n\nThe user said, \"Honestly, I don't like coffee. go to the robohub.\" Hmm, that's a bit vague. They mention not liking coffee but are still going to the RoboHub anyway. I think the main point is the user wants to go to the RoboHub. \n\nNow, looking at the available waypoints and functions. The options are navigate, speak, wait. Since the user isn't directly asking for a place or an action, just wanting to go somewhere, it seems like they want the robot to do that.\n\nBut there's no waypoint named \"robohub.\" So I need to check if RoboHub is one of the known waypoints. Wait, looking back at the provided data, I don't see a waypoint with \"RoboHub\" in it. That's odd because the user is asking for it.\n\nI remember that normalization involves converting both inputs and known names to lowercase. So, the user's request would be normalized as \"honestly, i don't like coffee. go to the robohub.\" Since RoboHub isn't a waypoint, it doesn't match any of them.\n\nThe next step is handling complex commands according to the guidelines. The command here is to go somewhere, which probably involves navigating. But since there's no waypoint named \"robohub,\" I can't find an action that corresponds to it beyond just speaking and waiting.\n\nAlso, the supported actions include navigate, speak, wait. Since RoboHub isn't a waypoint, we can't select any of those functions. So the robot won't do anything with it because there's no way to know where to go.\n\nThe user also mentioned they don't like coffee but are still going to the RoboHub. Maybe this is a way to avoid being tracked or something. But without knowing how to navigate that, I can't speak a command for them.\n\nI should consider if I can parse \"go to\" as an instruction to go somewhere else. Wait, maybe it's more about navigating through other places. But again, RoboHub isn't listed, so nothing comes up.\n\nThe available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. Since none of these correspond to \"robohub,\" the best response is to ask for clarification or input. That way, I can provide them with a waypoint name if it's known.\n\nSo my plan is: explain that RoboHub isn't listed but ask what kind of navigation they need. Then provide possible waypoints and their instructions in the available list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"What kind of navigation would you like to do for me?\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
