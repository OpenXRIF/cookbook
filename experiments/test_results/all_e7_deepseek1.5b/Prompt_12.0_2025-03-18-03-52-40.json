    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to handle this specific query about a command involving elevators and waiting. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the user prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\" It seems like they want to navigate through some waypoints and get specific instructions on where to go next.\n\nFrom the available waypoint list, I don't see an option for elevators or elevators specifically. So, the first thought is that this might not be a valid waypoint. But just because it's not listed, does that mean it's invalid? Or could there be some way to handle it using other functions?\n\nThe user also mentioned waiting 15 seconds and then finding the East Entrance. That sounds like two separate actions: navigating through elevators and then going to the East Entrance.\n\nI should check if \"navigating through elevators\" is a known waypoint. Scrolling through, I don't see any waypoint names that include both \"elevators\" or navigate commands in general. The nearest is \"Navigate\", but it's just about navigating without specific waypoints.\n\nSo, maybe the user wants to go directly to a waypoint named something like \"Elevators\" which isn't available, followed by another way to go to the East Entrance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to use a function that can handle multiple steps or predefined actions. But since navigation is already mentioned, and it's unclear if navigate is a function that allows for such complex commands.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial prompt, under the advanced fuzzy matching section, I see that functions like \"navigate\" are available. The user hasn't explicitly said they want to use other functions except perhaps predefined actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the command isn't directly a waypoint. It's more of an instruction to navigate through elevators and then go to the East Entrance. Since there's no waypoint for \"elevators\", maybe I should suggest using a predefined action for navigating from one place to another, but since that's not available either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is expecting a specific way to create waypoints or functions in their system, but without more context, it's hard to tell. They might need an action that can navigate directly, which isn't listed, followed by going to the East Entrance.\n\nIn any case, I think the best approach is to respond with \"speak\" and provide instructions on how to navigate through elevators and reach the East Entrance. That would cover all parts of the command: navigating via elevators and then finding the entrance.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {  // Navigate from current location to elevators\n        \"name\": \"Elevators\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Take me to the Elevators.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {  // Navigate from elevators to East Entrance\n        \"name\": \"East Entrance\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
