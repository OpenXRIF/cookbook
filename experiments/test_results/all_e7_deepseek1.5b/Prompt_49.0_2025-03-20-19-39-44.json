For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down how I approached this problem. The user provided a detailed prompt about matching waypoints with specific functions and handling complex commands. They wanted me to generate action commands based on their request.\n\nFirst, I noticed that the task was to navigate from one waypoint to another using predefined waypoints as intermediate points. The example given in the prompt showed multiple actions like \"navigate\", \"speak\", etc., which made sense when the user had specific locations or needed to interact with a person (like speaking).\n\nI started by understanding the structure of each waypoint, their names, and the available functions: navigate, speak, wait. I knew that the output would include these actions in a certain order based on the directions provided.\n\nNext, the prompt mentioned handling complex commands step-by-step. The user had to travel from one location to another and perform specific actions along the way. This required me to process each instruction sequentially, checking if each part of the command was met by existing waypoints or actions.\n\nI also considered supporting edge cases like unknown waypoints and unsupported actions, which needed special handling. If a waypoint wasn't found, it should trigger an \"speak\" action with an error message. For unsupported functions, another \"speak\" action was appropriate.\n\nIn this specific case, the user asked to go to the E5 Entrance first and then find the Microwaves. I identified both waypoints: the E5 Entrance is at (0.0, 0.0) and the Microwaves are located somewhere else. Since the Microwaves weren't specified with exact coordinates, the output should inform the user that it's an unknown waypoint.\n\nI made sure to structure the actions in a way that followed the left-to-right order of processing each command. The navigation from the E5 Entrance to the Micowaves would involve speaking the location of the entrance and navigating towards it, followed by checking for theMicrowaves.\n\nOverall, I broke down the problem into identifying waypoints, handling complex instructions, and addressing edge cases methodically. This approach ensures that the response is both accurate and user-friendly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 0.0,\n                \"y\": 0.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Can you find the Microwaves?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 257 - Microwaves\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 25\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
