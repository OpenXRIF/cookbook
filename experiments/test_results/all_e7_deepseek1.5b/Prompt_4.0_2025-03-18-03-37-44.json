    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the query \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" First, let's break down what this means. It seems like a simple command where the user wants to start from one point and then move to another specific location.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I notice there are several known waypoint names like Microwaves, Navigate, speak, and wait. I need to check if any of these match the request. The user is asking about moving from the South Entrance to the C&D - Coffee Area, which sounds like it's related to navigation.\n\nWait a minute, the available waypoint \"Microwaves\" might not be directly relevant here. Maybe there are other functions or actions that can help with this task. Let me review the supported edge cases again. If a function is beyond what's listed, I have to return an action with the message about unsupported action. The supported actions are navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nSo, the user wants to move from one place to another, which suggests using navigation. But do any of the waypoint names contain \"Navigate\"? Let me check. Scanning through each waypoint name, I see words like Navigate, but not in a way that matches this request. Maybe there's another function or action that serves the same purpose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the query is more about initiating an action rather than moving to a location. But since the user mentions going \"to\" the C&D - Coffee Area, it seems like they want to navigate from one place to another.\n\nI also need to consider if any waypoint names might represent the starting or ending points. The South Entrance and C&D - Coffee Area are both waypoints mentioned in the available list. Maybe \"Start at the South Entrance\" is a way to initiate the action, but it's not exactly clear how that ties into navigation.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is trying to navigate from the South Entrance using other known waypoint names as intermediaries. But if none of the waypoint names are related to this request, I might have to output an action about unsupported function. However, \"navigate\" is a supported action, so maybe that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, could the query be broken down into multiple actions? For example, first navigate from the South Entrance and then move to C&D - Coffee Area using another function or action. But since navigation is required, perhaps it's better to stick with that approach.\n\nI'm a bit confused because none of the waypoint names seem directly related to moving between two points. Maybe there are additional functions beyond \"navigate\" that can be used for this purpose. Let me review the supported actions again. The supported ones are navigate, speak, and wait. So if the user wants to initiate an action without any intermediate steps, they have to choose navigate.\n\nBut since the query is about moving from one place to another, maybe it's not a single command but more of an instruction that could be addressed by the \"navigate\" function in combination with other actions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example prompts provided, I see instances where multiple commands are handled sequentially. For instance, navigating to a location and then speaking or waiting. But in this case, it's just a simple request without any intermediate steps mentioned.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to treat \"navigate\" as the primary function here because it's the main action needed. Even though it doesn't directly involve other waypoints, using navigate would be the most logical starting point.\n\nI think I'll proceed with treating this as a navigation problem and use the navigate function. If none of the waypoint names can be used for navigating between those two points, then maybe there's an issue that needs attention or perhaps the user has to specify a new waypoint name.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"South Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 0.0,\n        \"y\": 0.0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
