    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query about taking them to the E7 silent study. Let's start by breaking down what they're asking for.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided, there are several waypoints mentioned, each with their own names and locations. The example given was a navigation request, but this is different\u2014it's more of an address. So I need to see if there's a waypoint named \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nLooking through the available list, I don't see anything like that. The closest might be \"Shower A\" or other commands. Since it's not a known waypoint, according to the guidelines, I should return an action where the input is \"This waypoint does not exist.\" \n\nI also need to make sure I'm following the advanced fuzzy matching rules they mentioned. Normalization and extraneous token removal were applied in that example with specific names, but since E7 silent study isn't there, it's a straightforward case here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the response should be an action where the input is as specified, which is \"speak\" with the message about the waypoint not existing.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
