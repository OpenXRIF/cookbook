    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The user says, \"go to the vending machines and get me a lays bbq chips.\" First, I should break down what each part means.\n\nVending machines are probably in the available waypoint list. So, I should look for any waypoint that has \"vending machines\" as one of its tokens. Once found, the user needs to go there.\n\nNext, getting chips is another task. I need a waypoint named \"gets a lays bbq chips.\" Wait, is that correct? Maybe it's better to write it as \"get (lays bbq chips)\" for clarity.\n\nI should check both waypoints in my list. If neither exists, the action should be to speak with an error message. Also, if any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is requested, I have to include that information.\n\nIn this case, the user only specified two actions: go to a vending machine and get chips. So, I'll need to structure the input as \"go to (name of vending machine)\" and \"get ((lays bbq chips))\". That way, when the system executes it, it will navigate to the vending machine, then retrieve the chips.\n\nI should also ensure that the system can parse these commands in order. So, the user's prompt is processed step by step: first go there, then get the chips. If either step isn't found in the waypoint list, I'll have to respond with an action indicating that it doesn't exist.\n\nHmm, but I don't know which waypoints are available yet. I need to look back at the provided data. Let me scan through the waypoint names:\n\n- Vending machines: There's a \"Vending Machines\" waypoint.\n- Chips related: \"gets a lays bbq chips\" is another one.\n\nSo both of these should be in the known list. Now, putting it all together, the input should instruct the system to navigate to the vending machine and retrieve the chips. I think that covers everything the user asked for without any extra complexities.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Vending Machines\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"get ((lays bbq chips))\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
