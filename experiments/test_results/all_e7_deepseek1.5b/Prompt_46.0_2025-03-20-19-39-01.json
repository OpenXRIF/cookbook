For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "Prompt ID": 46.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user with their prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the example prompts they gave. In one example, when someone asks for something, like keys, they navigate where the keys are, ask the question, drop them off, wait, and get another action. So it seems that each action is triggered based on a waypoint or specific commands.\n\nSo the user wants to go from E5 Entrance to Microwaves. Wait, but Microwaves isn't a waypoint listed here. The known waypoints are places like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub, etc. So microwaves aren't available as waypoints. That might be a problem because we can't directly go there.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user means to find theMicrowave or something similar? Or perhaps they meant Micawave itself isn't present, but that's not likely. Alternatively, could it mean going through another waypoint where you can access microwaves?\n\nLooking back at the available waypoints: E5 Entrance is a known waypoint. So traveling from E5 Entrance to Microwaves might involve navigating around, using an entranceway or perhaps moving through another structure.\n\nBut since Micawave isn't listed as a waypoint, I need to figure out if there's a way to go from E5 Entrance to Microwaves via other means. Maybe they can enter the microwaves' area by using an entrance similar to E5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to get access to theMicrowave place through another route. Perhaps it's part of the same zone or requires navigating around something.\n\nWait, but without a waypoint named Microwaves, we have to assume that navigation from E5 Entrance leads directly to someplace else, and then using that to reach Microwaves. Maybe by going into a specific path or using an entranceway in another known area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to move through the zone by navigating around something like an office building or similar structure. So moving from E5 Entrance to somewhere inside the zone that can be used to access Microwaves.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what the microwaves are part of, it's a bit unclear. Maybe they want to go into another room or through a specific path within the zone where Microwaves is accessible.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user wants to use the E5 Entrance as an entrance point for something else. For example, maybe they need to enter a hallway leading to Microwaves' area. So navigating around the E5 Entrance allows them to access a room or space where Microwaves can be found.\n\nBut in the absence of a waypoint named Microwaves, I have to figure out an alternative way. Perhaps the microwaves are part of another known waypoint or require navigating through a specific structure within the zone.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to find a way to enter that space by using the E5 Entrance as an entry point into another area where Microwaves can be accessed, perhaps via a lock or door. But without knowing exactly how Microwaves are part of the zone, it's hard to pinpoint.\n\nWait, maybe they meant microwaves in general, but that doesn't make sense. So probably, microwaves is a typo and should refer to something else, like another waypoint or an area within the zone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the microwaves are accessible through navigating around other known waypoints before reaching them. For example, going into a room called \"E1\", then from there, entering Micawave's area.\n\nBut without knowing the exact location of each waypoint, it's tricky. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that to get to Microwaves, you need to go through another specific point or room in the zone, which is already covered by known waypoints like E1.\n\nSo perhaps the user wants to navigate to a point where both E5 Entrance and the microwaves' area are accessible. Maybe moving around an office building or similar structure requires navigating around E5 Entrance into a space that leads to Micawaves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Microwaves is part of a larger zone and can be accessed via another known waypoint inside it, but without more information, it's hard to specify.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"find the Microwaves.\" Maybe they mean to find the microwave oven or something. So perhaps navigating around E5 Entrance allows them into a section where microwaves are stored or accessible through an exit point in that zone.\n\nBut again, without knowing exactly how the microwaves' area is part of the zones, it's challenging to create a precise action list.\n\nIn any case, based on the available waypoints and their structure, I can outline actions that would guide someone from E5 Entrance to enter another relevant waypoint or area within the zone where Microwaves are accessible. This might involve navigating around other known points in the zone, moving into specific rooms, using an exit point for entry, etc.\n\nSo putting it all together, my response should acknowledge the user's request, list the known waypoints that can be navigated from E5 Entrance, and suggest actions like entering another room, using a specific exit point, or navigating around other structures in the zone to reach Microwaves.\n</think>\n\nTo assist with your request of \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves,\" here's an organized approach based on the available information:\n\n1. **Navigate from E5 Entrance**: Recognize that the known waypoint is E5 Entrance, allowing you to move through a space accessible via this point.\n\n2. **Explore Relevant Areas**: Utilize other waypoints such as E1, F3, and others to navigate around or enter sections of the zone where Microwaves are part of the structure.\n\n3. **Enter Microwaves' Area**: Through these exploration points, you can find or access areas within the zone that contain Microwaves, likely through navigating into specific rooms or using an exit point for entry.\n\n4. **Action Sequence**:\n   - Navigate around E5 Entrance to explore adjacent spaces.\n   - Use existing room navigation tools to enter relevant areas.\n   - Move into rooms labeled \"E2,\" \"F3,\" etc., which may lead to Micawave access.\n   - Utilize exit points or doorways in these rooms for entry into the Microwaves' area.\n\nThis approach ensures you efficiently navigate through the zone and reach theMicrowave space as intended.",
