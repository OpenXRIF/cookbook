    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. They want me to take them through a series of actions step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements clearly.\n\nThe user provided an example where they wanted to \"take me to shower A, then shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B...\" So it seems like they're using specific waypoints and functions in a structured way. They mentioned using navigate for moving around, speak for asking questions, and wait as well.\n\nLooking back at the guidelines, I see that when matching waypoint names, there are several steps involved. First, normalization\u2014turning everything to lowercase. Then removing extraneous tokens like building codes or non-essential ones at the beginning. Tokenization is another step where both the user's input and each known waypoint are split into individual words.\n\nFor similarity calculation, I need to check if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input. Or alternatively, that a high percentage (like 80%) of the tokens are present. If not, consider it a match only if most tokens align.\n\nHandling complex commands involves processing them left-to-right without skipping steps unless specified otherwise. If multiple interpretations exist, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. Supported edge cases include returning actions for unknown waypoints and dealing with unsupported actions like speaking instead of another action.\n\nIn this case, the user wants to navigate through different areas: Shower A, then shower B after waiting 1 minute. I need to map each area to a waypoint and use the functions available (navigate, speak, wait) in the correct order and number.\n\nFirst, I should identify or create waypoints for each location mentioned. Since the existing data has specific names like \"C and D areas,\" \"RoboHub Entrance,\" etc., but it's limited. The user needs to navigate through shower A, then B, with a waiting period at B.\n\nI'll need to structure my response using the specified format, including actions like navigating, speaking, and waiting in separate parts. Also, each action should have inputs like waypoints or locations.\n\nWait, I'm not sure if there are specific ways to handle \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B.\" Do these correspond to existing waypoints? If not, maybe they'll need to be created or mapped through the normalization and similarity steps. But since this is a prompt example, perhaps it's better to stick with predefined names.\n\nI should also check if I'm using the correct functions: navigate for moving, speak for asking, wait as well. Each action will correspond to these functions in order of their priority or specific instructions from the user.\n\nPutting it all together, my response should guide the user step by step, ensuring they can follow each action correctly without getting lost.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A\",\n        \"x\": 10,\n        \"y\": 30\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 50,\n        \"y\": 40\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 23 - Ideas Clinic\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
