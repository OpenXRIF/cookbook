    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to translate this user prompt into an action plan using the provided system. The prompt says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoint names, there's one called \"E and 215 - Room 7421 - Idea Lab.\" So that seems relevant for finding the Microwaves. The microwaves are labeled as \"308-679-672,\" which I think is a phone number. So maybe the user wants to get in contact there.\n\nThe user also mentioned traveling from E5 Entrance, so I should consider where E5 Entrance is located. It's probably inside a zone, maybe Room 1413 - E and 215 Zone. The microwaves are in the same room, right? So if I go to E5 Entrance, I might get directions or find something there.\n\nNow, for the navigation part. Since the user is moving from one place to another inside a zone, I should suggest going north into Room 1413 - E and 215 Zone. That makes sense because that's where both the entrance and microwaves are.\n\nFor speaking actions, once at E5 Entrance, the user can ask for the microwaves by phone. So I'll need to include a command like \"speak\" with an input of \"308-679-672\" or similar.\n\nWait, but should I mention going north as part of the navigation? Yes, because the microwaves are in that area. Maybe after entering the zone, if the user doesn't know where to go specifically, they can just navigate north into Room 1413.\n\nAlso, since there's only one waypoint named \"E and 215 - Room 7421 - Idea Lab\" with Microwaves, I need to make sure that's correctly matched in the system. Otherwise, it might not find anything, which could cause issues like showing an action where nothing happened.\n\nI should also think about the edge cases. If the user forgets a waypoint or something is missing from their knowledge base, they'll get an \"action: speak\" with the message about unknown waypoint. But in this case, I have a valid waypoint, so that's good.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions would involve navigating into the zone and then accessing the microwaves through phone contact within that zone. That should cover both traveling to E5 Entrance and finding the microwaves as per the prompt.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E and 215 - Room 7421 - Idea Lab\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 80\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"308-679-672\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
