    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The prompt says, \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\" So, first, I need to understand what's being asked here.\n\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it seems that each waypoint has a name and some coordinates. The known waypoints include things like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" with specific X and Y coordinates. Now, the user is asking about a robot performing an action: going to a temporary booth and waiting for 30 minutes.\n\nHmm, this isn't one of the predefined waypoints we have in the list. So, I need to check if there's any waypoint named \" temporarily\" or something similar that could represent the location of the temporary booth. Alternatively, maybe it refers to a waypoint with a name that includes \" booth.\"\n\nWait, let me see the available known waypoint names: they are things like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Coffee & Chicken,\" and so on, up to waypoints named \"unknown.\" None of these seem to include a term related to a temporary location. So, perhaps this request isn't covered by any predefined action.\n\nGiven that, according to the guidelines provided earlier, if none of the known waypoint names match the user's query, the response should be an action where the input is \"This waypoint does not exist.\" That makes sense because the system needs to know when it doesn't recognize a specific command or location.\n\nSo, putting this together, the output should be an array with one element. The action is \"speak,\" and the input is the specified text that says, \"This waypoint does not exist.\" This way, the user knows that they're talking about something not recognized by the system's known waypoints.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
