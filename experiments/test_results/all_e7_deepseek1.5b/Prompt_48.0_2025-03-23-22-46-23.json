For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"\n",

    "Prompt ID": 48.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this prompt where someone asks to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints: there's a Microwaves waypoint which probably has an entrance location. The user wants both the E5 Entrance and then reach theMicrowave room.\n\nI remember from the examples that when commands are about navigating or asking, you use specific functions like navigate and speak. So for traveling to a place, I might need a left-to-right parsing approach because they don't have spaces in their names.\n\nWait, but some way points have spaces which might indicate separate actions. For example, if someone goes through an area and then inside, maybe that's two steps. But the user's prompt is about moving from one place to another, so I need a function for that\u2014maybe 'navigate' can handle multiple points by parsing left-to-right.\n\nSo step one: parse \"E5 Entrance\" as the first point. I'll look up where E5 Entrance is located. Let me check the normalization steps they mentioned\u2014they suggest converting to lowercase and removing prefixes like numbers or letters at the start. But in this case, both are lowercase without such issues, so that's straightforward.\n\nOnce I have E5 Entrance, then I need to navigate from there to the Microwaves. That means another 'navigate' function for moving between two waypoint names. But wait, is the Microwaves waypoint's name already parsed? Or should I normalize it?\n\nLooking back at the normalization steps: first, convert both user input and waypoint names to lowercase, then remove tokens with letters and numbers at the start. So if Microwaves has a \"room 1427\", which includes numbers, maybe that's part of the path.\n\nWait, in the example prompt I gave earlier, when they used something like RoboHub Entrance, it was treated as two 'navigate' commands. So for this case, after going to E5 Entrance, navigating again towards Microwaves.\n\nBut before I jump into writing code, let me think about the functions available: navigate, speak, wait. Since I need two navigations, I'll use twice the 'navigate' function: once from E5 Entrance to somewhere else (which is just a dummy place like room 1427), and then again from there to Microwaves.\n\nWait, but in the example prompt, they used 'navigate Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic', which makes sense because it's one command. So maybe I can parse that as a single 'navigate' function call with two waypoints: room 1427 and the destination (which is just the end point). Or perhaps use nested functions if allowed, but in this case, since only navigate is available, I need to have separate commands.\n\nBut looking back at the user's prompt again: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" So it's two separate locations, so two 'navigate' commands. But in the example given by the assistant, they used two 'navigate' actions for that task. Hmm, maybe I need to use left-to-right parsing for each step.\n\nSo, first navigate from E5 Entrance to somewhere (room 1427), and then navigate again from there to Microwaves. So yes, two separate calls.\n\nBut wait, is there a waypoint named 'Microwaves'? Let me check the provided data. The user included a waypoint called Microwaves with \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\", which seems like the correct name. So it's likely available in their list.\n\nSo, to handle this:\n\n1. Get E5 Entrance coordinates.\n2. Navigate from there using 'navigate' to room 1427 (which is default since no destination).\n3. Then navigate again from room 1427 to Microwaves.\n\nEach of these will be separate actions, so two 'navigate' calls with their respective waypoints.\n\nI should make sure that I'm parsing each step correctly, ensuring that the waypoints are normalized as per the rules. Also, check if there's a way to combine them into one command, but since I can only use navigate for multiple points by calling it twice, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nWait, in the user's example, they used \"navigate Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" which is just the destination. So perhaps I should do something similar here: when navigating from E5 Entrance to Microwaves, use a waypoint named like \"Room X - [ destination ]\", where X is the next point.\n\nBut in our case, after room 1427, it's directly to Microwaves. Wait no\u2014theMicrowave is at a specific place within the same building, so maybe there are two points: E5 Entrance and then inside, but I think the user wants to go from E5 Entrance to room 1427 (the entry point) first, then navigate again from there towards Microwaves.\n\nWait, no. TheMicrowave is at \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\", which might be a separate location after room 1427. So perhaps I need two 'navigate' calls: first to room 1427, then from room 1427 to Microwaves.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in the code, when parsing the command \"travel to E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves\", I'll break it into:\n\n- navigate from E5 Entrance to room 1427\n- navigate from room 1427 to Microwaves\n\nEach as separate 'navigate' commands.\n\nI think that's how it should be handled.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to navigate through two specific waypoints: the \"E5 Entrance\" and the \"Microwaves\" waypoint. Each will require a separate navigation command.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Navigate from E5 Entrance to room 1427 - Ideas Clinic**\n   - Use the `navigate` function with parameters `(E5 Entrance, Room X - [ destination ])`.\n   \n2. **Navigate from room 1427 - Ideas Clinic to Microwaves**\n   - Again use the `navigate` function for this step.\n\n**Code Representation:**\n\n```javascript\nnavigate(E5 Entrance, Room X - Ideas Clinic)\nnavigate(Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic, Microwaves)\n```\n\nEach navigation is handled separately using the `navigate` function.",
