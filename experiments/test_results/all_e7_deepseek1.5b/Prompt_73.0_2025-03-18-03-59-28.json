    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond when the user says, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Hmm, first I need to understand what the user is asking for. They're mentioning going to a bathroom or shower area, but they don't specify where exactly.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints and functions, it seems like the system can navigate to specific locations based on waypoint names. So maybe the user wants me to find the nearest access point that has a \"shower\" function.\n\nWait, I should check if there's any waypoint named \"shower\" or if the functionality allows for specifying where in the complex command they want it done. Since the example prompt talked about navigating and then waiting, perhaps it's not just one place but multiple steps.\n\nI remember that when matching waypoints, it's case-insensitive because normalization is done. So the input would be normalized to \"i could really go for a shower.\" Then I need to see if any waypoint matches this request in terms of function or location.\n\nSince \"shower\" isn't listed as a waypoint, maybe I have to use the default action and specify where to go based on another waypoint. Or perhaps it's expecting multiple actions: navigate to the bathroom first, then wait there for 10 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the user just said \"I could really go for a shower.\" That doesn't explicitly ask for a location, so maybe I should output a speak action with an error because it's an invalid request. Or perhaps they meant to specify which waypoint is associated with a shower function.\n\nAlternatively, considering the complex command handling rules, since there are multiple steps, I might need to break down the request into actions. But without knowing where the shower is located or how long it should wait, this could get tricky.\n\nI think the best approach here is to respond that the request is invalid because \"shower\" isn't a known waypoint. So the output would be an action like \"speak\" with the message: \"Invalid request: 'shower' is not a valid waypoint.\" That way, it's clear and within the system's guidelines.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'shower' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
