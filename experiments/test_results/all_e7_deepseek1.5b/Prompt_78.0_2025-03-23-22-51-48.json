For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to handle this prompt step by step. The user wants a detailed action plan using the provided waypoint list and functions like Navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the entire instruction into individual commands. It seems like there are several steps involved:\n\n1. Start at the West Entrance and navigate toward Shower A.\n2. Then go to Silent Study and pause for 10 seconds.\n3. Next, continue to Novelties.\n4. After that, move to Ideas Clinic.\n5. Conclude the test by reaching the South Entrance.\n\nEach of these steps is a separate command I need to process. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nStarting with the first step: navigating from the West Entrance to shower A. From the waypoint list, the closest entrance near shower A is the Shower B. So, I'll have to go west entrance -> shower b -> shower a? Wait, no. Wait A and shower B are different places. Looking back at the waypoints, shower A is listed as another waypoint name. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the waypoints provided, there's shower B defined. But shower A isn't mentioned elsewhere except possibly through its name. So, if I need to navigate from west entrance toward shower a, which is a separate waypoint. Hmm, but looking at the available waypoints: Robot, begin at the West Entrance, navigate toward Shower A.\n\nWait, so first step: start at west entrance and navigate toward shower a. That would be directly to shower a's location. But in the waypoints, shower b exists, but not shower a. So this is confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe shower a isn't available as a waypoint? Or maybe it's another part of the path.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial prompt for understanding the waypoints, I see that Shower A is mentioned as a waypoint name in the user's example. Oh wait, no, actually, looking at the waypoints list: the only names with words are \"Robot\", \"begin at the West Entrance\", and then various waypoints like \"RoboHub\", etc. So shower A isn't listed as a waypoint.\n\nWait, that might be an error. The user's example prompt shows steps using shower A, but in the available waypoints, there's no shower A. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided waypoints:\n\n- Shower B is defined, but not shower A.\n\nSo if I have to navigate toward shower a, but shower a isn't a waypoint, how can I do that? Maybe it's a typo in the example. Or perhaps it refers to a different location. Alternatively, maybe \"navigating toward shower a\" means going to the nearest known entrance or another specific path.\n\nWait, if I'm at the west entrance and navigate toward shower a, but there's no such waypoint available, that's an issue. Perhaps I should go to the west entrance, then proceed west further, or use another waypoint that's available.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"navigating toward shower A\" is a misphrase, and they meant something else, like starting at the west entrance and moving towards shower B if it exists? Wait, shower B is defined. So perhaps I'm supposed to navigate from west entrance toward shower b first?\n\nBut in the initial prompt for understanding the waypoints, the user's example uses shower A, but in reality, the available waypoints are shower B only. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the step-by-step explanation. They mention navigating from the West Entrance and then proceed to another location. So maybe I need to find a way to navigate from west entrance toward shower A, but since there's no such waypoint, perhaps the closest is shower B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"navigating toward shower A\" refers to moving in a certain path relative to the west entrance. But without knowing exactly where shower A is located relative to the west entrance, I'm unsure how to proceed.\n\nWait, looking back at the waypoints provided, the only other known waypoint besides Robot and begin is shower B and RoboHub. So perhaps this step isn't possible with the given waypoints. Maybe it's a mistake in the user's prompt or my misunderstanding of the waypoints.\n\nIn any case, moving forward, I'll have to address each command separately, assuming that the waypoints are correctly defined as per the initial list provided by the user.\n\nSo for each command:\n\n1. Start at west entrance and navigate toward shower A.\n2. Then go to silent study and pause for 10 seconds.\n3. Continue to novelties.\n4. After that, move to ideas clinic.\n5. Conclude test by reaching south entrance smoothly.\n\nEach of these is a separate action with their own input parameters.\n\nBut wait, the waypoint list doesn't include shower A or north entrance. So maybe I need to find alternative locations for each step. For example, if west entrance is at (0,0), perhaps shower A is another point relative to that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo and the user meant shower B, which exists. But since it's shower A, I have to proceed without knowing its location.\n\nIn any case, I'll need to outline each command with the necessary parameters based on the given waypoints.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured plan addressing each step of the user's instructions using the provided waypoint list and the understanding that \"navigating toward shower A\" refers to navigating from the west entrance towards another known location (e.g., shower b) if available.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1. **Start at West Entrance**\n   - **Action:** Begin your journey at the west entrance.\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - West Entrance Location\n   - **Output:** You are now positioned at the west entrance, ready to proceed.\n\n2. **Navigating toward Shower B**\n   - **Action:** From the west entrance, navigate toward shower b if available (based on waypoint availability).\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - Directions relative to west entrance\n     - Target location (shower b)\n   - **Output:** You are now at shower b's location.\n\n3. **Moving to Silent Study**\n   - **Action:** From shower b, move to the silent study.\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - Destination: Silent Study Location\n   - **Output:** You reach the silent study entrance smoothly.\n\n4. ** Pausing for 10 Seconds**\n   - **Action:** Pause your movement at the silent study.\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - Pause duration (10 seconds)\n   - **Output:** You are here for a brief 10-second pause.\n\n5. **Navigating toward Novelties**\n   - **Action:** From silent study, navigate towards novelties.\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - Directions relative to silent study\n     - Target location (novelties)\n   - **Output:** You are at novelties if the waypoint is available.\n\n6. **Moving to Ideas Clinic**\n   - **Action:** From novelties, move toward ideas clinic.\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - Directions relative to novelties\n     - Target location (ideas clinic)\n   - **Output:** You reach ideas clinic smoothly.\n\n7. **Concluding the Test**\n   - **Action:** From ideas clinic, navigate back towards the south entrance or the west entrance to conclude the test.\n   - **Input Parameters:**\n     - Directions relative to ideas clinic\n     - Target location (south entrance)\n   - **Output:** You are now at the south entrance, ready to conclude your task.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Actions and Inputs:\n\n1.
