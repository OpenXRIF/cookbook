The user said, \"Take my to the HubRobo.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, I don't see a \"HubRobo\" waypoint listed. So that means there are no known ways to take someone to HubRobo. \n\nI remember from the rules that if a waypoint isn't found, we have to return an action where it says \"speak\" and mention that it doesn't exist. But wait, let me check if HubRobo is even in the available list. Scanning through all the waypoints provided... Nope, it's not there.\n\nSo following the steps I learned, when no waypoint matches, we just respond by saying this input does not exist. The action should be \"speak\" and include the message about the unknown waypoint. That makes sense because if something isn't recognized, the user shouldn't have any options beyond speaking a simple message.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. No complex commands or ambiguous points since we're just dealing with an invalid request.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'HubRobo' is not a known waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
