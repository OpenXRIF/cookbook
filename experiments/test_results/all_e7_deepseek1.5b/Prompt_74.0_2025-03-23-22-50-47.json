For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's request using the given system. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the example prompt provided: \"Robot, begin at the North Entrance and proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance to check for any obstructions.\" The expected output is a list of actions with specific inputs like waypoint names and coordinates.\n\nThe user wants me to process this into something similar but without quotes. So, I need to structure it properly using JSON.\n\nI remember that in the system, starting locations are 0.0, which probably refers to (x=0, y=0). The waypoint names can be anything except those with letters and digits at the beginning or end, so I have to normalize them first by lowercasing.\n\nFor normalization, both the user's input and each waypoint name should be converted to lowercase. That makes it easier for comparison later on.\n\nNext, I need to process the waypoint list. The available waypoint names are:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - Main Entrance\n- C&D - Obstructions\n- Silent Study\n- shower A\n- shower B\n\nEach of these has specific coordinates in x and y.\n\nNow, looking at the user's prompt: they start by going from North Entrance to C&D - Main Entrance for obstructions. Then they go to Microwaves, ensure units are operational, then Silent Study, check environment, move to Shower A and shower B, inspect cleanliness, and finally head back to South Entrance.\n\nI need to structure this as a list of actions with their respective waypoints and coordinates.\n\nWait, but the system's output for known commands includes navigate, speak, wait. So I should make sure each action is within these keywords.\n\nLet me try mapping each step:\n\n1. Begin at North Entrance \u2192 C&D - Main Entrance\n2. Proceed to check obstructions at C&D - Obstructions\n3. Visit Microwaves area\n4. Ensure units are operational\n5. Go to Silent Study\n6. Verify environment is quiet\n7. Navigate to shower A and shower B\n8. Inspect cleanliness, which probably includes showering?\n9. Move back to South Entrance\n\nWait, maybe the order can be adjusted because moving from shower A and shower B might bypass some steps. But I think following the user's original prompt as closely as possible is better.\n\nSo each action should correspond to a waypoint with its coordinates. For example:\n\n- Start at North Entrance (C&D - North Entrance) \u2192 waypoint 25,50\n- Check obstructions at C&D - Obstructions \u2192 waypoint 1426,79\n- Visit Microwaves area \u2192 waypoint 387,102\n- Ensure units are operational \u2192 waypoint 400,105\n- Go to Silent Study \u2192 waypoint 250,92\n- Verify environment \u2192 waypoint 285,100 (if that's the corner)\n- Move to shower A and shower B. Wait, but shower A and shower B are two waypoints. So I might need to navigate through both, maybe in a specific order.\n- Inspect cleanliness, which could involve going back or following previous paths.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should list each action step by step, assigning the correct waypoint and coordinates.\n\nI think that's how it works now. Each command corresponds to an action with its waypoints. The system will process them one by one.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 50\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Obstructions\",\n        \"x\": 1426,\n        \"y\": 79\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Microwaves area\",\n        \"x\": 387,\n        \"y\": 102\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Silent Study\",\n        \"x\": 250,\n        \"y\": 92\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \" shower A\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n        \"x\": 827,\n        \"y\": 610\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"You will move to shower A and shower B after completing the environment verification.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
