They provided a detailed prompt and some examples, so I need to make sure I follow all the guidelines given.\n\nFirst, I should look at the available waypoints. From what's listed, there are commands like move to RoboHub, pick up keys, drop off keys, navigate through a room, etc. The user is asking for a specific command: \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study's.\" \n\nHmm, I don't see any waypoint named \"proceed to\" or \"Silent Study's\". So I might need to handle this as an invalid request. But wait, looking back at the examples, when a waypoint doesn't exist, it returns an action with \"speak\" and the message saying the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo in this case, since there's no waypoint for Silent Study's or \"proceed to\", I should output that it doesn't exist. I also need to ensure I'm following all the steps given, like normalization, tokenization, similarity matching, etc., but in this scenario, the issue is just lack of a known waypoint.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Just return an action with the message about the missing waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'silent study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
