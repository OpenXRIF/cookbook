For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"I could really go for a shower.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query about going for a shower. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided prompts and examples, it seems like the system is designed to handle commands that involve navigating through waypoints or accessing specific areas within a given location. The user can request something from certain zones (like C and D areas) and then drop it off at another zone, while waiting for someone in their path.\n\nIn this case, the user says, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Now, I need to parse what they're asking. It sounds like they want them to take a shower, probably within a specific area that's designated for that purpose. So, I should check if there are waypoints related to the shower command.\n\nLooking back at the waypoint list, I see several shower-related entries: Shower B is mentioned with certain coordinates and commands. For example, Shower B has a normalized input of \"barb 827.0 610.0\" which translates to its normalized version as \"barb\". So, that's one option.\n\nAdditionally, the command \"navigate to shower zone\" seems relevant because showering is typically an individual action within a specific area. The example given in the prompt involves navigating from a start point to a room for a meeting and then waiting.\n\nI should consider both options: using Shower B or going via other areas. Since I have multiple waypoint names, but the normalized approach allows me to match as long as tokens are present without requiring all being essential.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to suggest going directly to the shower zone, which is a more direct action. Also, since the user didn't specify needing to wait or navigate through other areas first, maybe just navigating to the shower location would suffice.\n\nWait, but looking at the examples given, when the user asks for something from a specific area, they provide the coordinates as input. So in this case, I should probably request the shower zone's coordinates.\n\nI remember that in previous steps, the normalized input is converted to lowercase and tokens are removed. But since the normalization here might not change anything because it's just about lowercasing, but perhaps for certain commands like \"navigate,\" if there are building codes or letters at the beginning, they're discarded.\n\nSo, to request the shower location, I need to provide its normalized name and coordinates. Looking through the waypoints, Shower B is mentioned with coordinates 827 and 610. So that should be straightforward.\n\nPutting it all together, the system should first check if there's a waypoint named \"shower\" or \"navigate to shower zone.\" Since shower isn't directly listed, but using the command \"navigate to shower zone,\" I can suggest the coordinates of the shower area.\n\nI might also consider waiting, but maybe the user just wants to go. Without more context, it's safer to assume a direct navigation request. So the system will output an action to navigate to the shower zone at the specified coordinates.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"shower\",\n                \"x\": 827,\n                \"y\": 610\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
