    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help with this prompt where the user says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints. There are several: shower A, coffee area (which is probably C&D), microwaves, and others like E1 entrance, ideas clinic, etc. The user is asking to go to an entrance and then find a microwave, so I need to identify which of these waypoints match that request.\n\nStarting with \"E5 Entrance.\" That's one of the known waypoint names. So that should be matched as the first action: navigate to E5 Entrance. Then, after finding it, the user wants to find the Microwaves. Hmm, microwaves are probably a separate waypoint named something like Microwaves or maybe Microwave Zone. Since the available list has \"Microwaves\" as an entry, that should be matched next.\n\nSo, in action order, I'd first navigate to E5 Entrance. Then, upon finding it, perform another navigation to the Micawave area. The commands would involve specifying the path for both entrances and then locating the microwave zone.\n\nI also need to make sure that \"navigate\" is used correctly each time since the user wants to physically move around, not just ask a question. So the actions should be navigate E5 Entrance first, wait if necessary (though in this case, it might not require waiting), and then navigate Micawaves after finding E5.\n\nWait, but the microwaves are probably in their own area, so when navigating to them from E5, there might be a path or route between these two. But since they're separate waypoints, each needs to be matched individually.\n\nSo putting it all together, the actions would involve two \"navigate\" commands: one for E5 Entrance and then another for Micawaves. Each with their respective input coordinates.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 0,\n                \"y\": 0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Micawaves\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 60\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
