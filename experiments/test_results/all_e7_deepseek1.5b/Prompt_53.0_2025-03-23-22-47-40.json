For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to respond to this query. The user provided a detailed prompt about handling waypoints and matching them with known locations. They want me to explain my thought process as if I'm thinking through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a series of waypoints like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, and so on, each located at specific coordinates. The goal is to navigate from one point to another based on these waypoints.\n\nThe user's example prompt shows how they want to move through different areas by navigating between waypoints. For instance, going from the C area to the RoboHub entrance, which has its own coordinates. It seems like they need a system where each waypoint is treated as a specific location that can be navigated to via certain keys or commands.\n\nSo, when someone gives them an input prompt, I have to parse it, normalize both the user's message and the waypoint names to lowercase. Then, remove any tokens that don't make sense at the beginning of the message. After that, split both into words and check for similarity between each waypoint name token and the user's input.\n\nI'll need to handle commands in a left-to-right sequence unless told otherwise. Also, if there are multiple interpretations possible, I should choose the one with the least backtracking. This might involve prioritizing certain waypoints over others based on their locations or usage.\n\nThe supported actions are navigate, speak, and wait. If any beyond that is requested, I have to return an action mentioning the unsupported action.\n\nNow, for the specific example given: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Micwaf\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, normalize both parts. The user's input becomes \"E 5 Entrance\" and \"find the Micwaf\". Then, remove any non-essential tokens like \"the\", \"and\", etc., leaving just \"E 5 Entrance\".\n\nNext, I'll look through the known waypoints to see which ones match. Let's list them out:\n\n1. E 5 Entrance\n2. Microf\n3. RoboHub\n4.Microwave\n5. Microwaves\n\nI need to check each waypoint against the user's message.\n\n- \"E 5 Entrance\" is a waypoint with coordinates (0,0). So that matches.\n- \"Microf\": Not sure what that is; it might be an unknown waypoint or a typo.\n- \"RoboHub\": Its name includes RoboHub, which is at (1427, 75).\n- \"Microwave\": One of the waypoints. Let's see if it has coordinates (0,0) for Microf and (1865,434) for Microwave.\n- \"Microwaves\": It might refer to all Microwaves, which includes both Microwave and possibly others.\n\nNow, I'll assess similarity:\n\n1. \"E 5 Entrance\" matches exactly with the user's input.\n2. \"RoboHub\" is at (1427,75) but the user didn't specify that location yet. So it's not there unless specified otherwise.\n3. \"Microwave\" is present in the waypoint list and located where?\n   Looking back, the Microwave is listed as having no specific coordinates provided. Hmm, maybe I need to assume based on other waypoints.\n\nWait, let me check the available waypoints again:\n\nThe user has a lot of waypoints: C&D - Coffee Area (0,0), RoboHub Entrance (25,50), shower B (827,610). Then others like E 5 Entrance, which is at 0,0; Microf is maybe elsewhere? Wait, no. Let me check the list again.\n\nThe list includes:\n\n- Various waypoints with different coordinates and descriptions.\n- The user's example prompt has \"E 5 Entrance\" which is (0,0), \"RoboHub\" is (1427,75), \"Microwave\" is at (1865,434). Wait, that seems inconsistent. Or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, the user's example in their prompt has:\n\n- E 5 Entrance: x=0,y=0\n- RoboHub Entrance: x=25,y=50\n\nThen, Microf is at (827,610). RoboHub is at (1427,75) and Microwave is at (1865,434).\n\nSo the Microwaves waypoint has no coordinates. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any waypoint matches both Microf and Microwave? Or maybe it's a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Microwave\" includes both Microwave and others that use microwave features. So maybe the user is using the term incorrectly or not specifying which one.\n\nBut in the example given by the user: they're asking for E 5 Entrance, then find the Micwaf. Maybe they meant Microwave?\n\nWait, the user wrote \"find the Micwaf\". Maybe a typo for Microwave? Or perhaps it's referring to microwave features elsewhere.\n\nGiven that, I think I'll proceed with:\n\n1. E 5 Entrance is at (0,0)\n2. RoboHub is at (1427,75) which might be different from the user's message\n3. Microf is at (827,610), not matching anything in the example.\n4. Microwave is at (1865,434), also different.\n\nSo, out of these, only \"E 5 Entrance\" matches the user's input exactly. So the response would be to navigate to E 5 Entrance and then try to find the Microwave.\n\nWait, but in the example prompt by the user, after navigating to E 5 Entrance, they were asked to find the Micwaf. Perhaps it was a typo for Microwave or another term.\n\nSo, following this logic, the response should be:\n\n\"Go to the E 5 Entrance and then locate the Microwave.\"\n\nI think that's how I would respond.\n</think>\n\nSure! Let me break down how I approached responding to your question about navigating from \"E 5 Entrance\" to \"Microwave\".\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n- **User Input:** \"Travel to the E 5 Entrance and then find the Micwaf.\"\n  \n- **Goal:** Navigate through waypoints starting at E 5 Entrance, then locate Microwave.\n\n### Normalization and Preprocessing:\n1. **Normalize the User's Message:**\n   - Convert all words to lowercase.\n   - Remove non-word tokens like \"and\", \"the\".\n   \n   Example: \n     - User Input \u2192 \"E 5 Entrance\" and \"find the Micwaf\"\n\n2. **Assume waypoint locations:**\n   - From the available waypoints:\n     - E 5 Entrance is at (0,0)\n     - RoboHub is at (1427,75)\n     - Microwave is at (1865,434) (note: no specific coordinates provided for \"Microwave\")\n\n### Similarity Check:\n- Compare user input tokens with waypoint names.\n  - \"E 5 Entrance\" matches exactly.\n  - \"RoboHub\" and \"Microwave\" are unknown or have not been assigned coordinate locations.\n  - \"Micwaf\" is either a typo or undefined.\n\n### Response Construction:\n1. Navigate to E 5 Entrance: `Go to the E 5 Entrance`\n2. Then locate Microwave: `Then, locate the Microwave`\n\nFinal Answer:\n- Go to the E 5 Entrance and then locate the Microwave.\n\nThis approach ensures that each part of the user's query is clearly understood and navigated through the provided waypoints.",
