    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm looking at this prompt: \"Where can I find an ark reactor, can you go there?\" Hmm, that's interesting. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is asking about locating a specific place and then suggesting going there. The phrase \"ark reactor\" makes me think of a chemical or industrial complex. I remember reading somewhere about R38000, which I believe is associated with such projects. It was a plant for nuclear reactions during the Cold War.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, there's an entry called \"Ark Reactor - Advanced Complex.\" That seems relevant because it mentions \"Ark reactor\" in its description. So that should be our match.\n\nNow, to handle the input correctly. The user is asking for directions and then suggesting a location. I need to structure this as a navigation action with specific coordinates. Since R38000's coordinates are given, I'll include those.\n\nI also notice they used \"can you go there,\" which is part of their request. That suggests that the output should acknowledge finding the place and moving there, so a speak action makes sense here.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions would first navigate to R38000 with its coordinates, then speak confirming where it's located. No need for waiting since they're directly asking about movement.\n</think>\n\nBased on the prompt \"Where can I find an ark reactor, can you go there?\", we need to identify a waypoint related to Ark Reactor and provide navigation instructions.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **navigate**  \n   - Input: `Ark Reactor - Advanced Complex`\n\nThis action directs the user to the Ark Reactor complex located at its specified coordinates.",
