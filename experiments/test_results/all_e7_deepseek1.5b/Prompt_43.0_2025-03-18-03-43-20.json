    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The prompt says, \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\" First, I should check if there are any known waypoints that match this request.\n\nLooking through the available waypoint names, I see entries for shower A, E7 silent study, E9 silent study, shower B, shower C, and Shower A. None of these seem like they could represent an unknown zone or a specific location beyond RoboHub. \n\nSince none of the known waypoints correspond to \"unknown zone\" or \"RoboHub,\" I need to handle this as a support case. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown, I should return an action where the input says \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nI also need to consider that the user might be confused about what's meant by \"unknown zone.\" Without more context or clarification, it's safe to assume that this is beyond the scope of known waypoints. Therefore, the appropriate response is to speak and inform the user that the waypoint they're asking for doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
