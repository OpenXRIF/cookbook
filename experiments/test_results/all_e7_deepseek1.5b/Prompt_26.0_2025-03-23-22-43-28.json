For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this query about navigating from the Micwae's back to the E5 Enterance. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that each waypoint has a specific location defined by coordinates. The user wants to navigate from theMicrowave location back to the E5 Enterance. So I need to check if both waypoints are valid and then find their positions to plan the path.\n\nI'll normalize both the starting point (0, 0) and the destination (E5 Enterance's X, Y coordinates). Then, I'll remove any extraneous tokens\u2014like prefixes or codes at the beginning. Once that's done, I'll split both into words.\n\nNext, for each waypoint, I'll compare their tokens to ensure they share enough similarity. If one waypoint meets the threshold, it becomes a match. But if multiple waypoints are close, I pick the highest matching one.\n\nI have to make sure the input is well-structured before processing commands, especially handling complex commands with multiple steps and actions. For this query, it's just two waypoints connected by navigation, so it should be straightforward.\n\nAfter determining the path, I'll construct a series of \"navigate\" actions for each location, starting from Micwae to E5 Enterance. That should give the user the necessary instructions to follow.\n</think>\n\nTo handle your request, here's the structured plan:\n\n1. **Check waypoint validity:**\n   - Verify if both \"Micwae's Back\" and \"E5 Enterance\" are valid waypoints as listed.\n   - If any waypoint is invalid or ambiguous, return a speak action with an error message.\n\n2. **Locate waypoints:**\n   - Fetch the coordinates of \"Micwae's Back\".\n   - Fetch the coordinates of \"E5 Enterance\".\n\n3. **Plan navigation path:**\n   - From \"Micwae's Back\", navigate back towards the origin.\n   - From the origin, proceed towards \"E5 Enterance\".\n\n4. **Generate actions:**\n   - Navigate to \"Micwae's Back\".\n   - Navigate to the origin (starting point).\n   - Navigate from the origin to \"E5 Enterance\".\n\n5. **Output instructions:**\n   ```\n   {\n     \"actions\": [\n       {\n         \"action\": \"navigate\",\n         \"input\": {\n           \"name\": \"Micwae's Back\",\n           \"x\": 100,\n           \"y\": 200\n         }\n       },\n       {\n         \"action\": \"navigate\",\n         \"input\": {\n           \"name\": \"Origin\",\n           \"x\": 0,\n           \"y\": 0\n         }\n       },\n       {\n         \"action\": \"navigate\",\n         \"input\": {\n           \"name\": \"E5 Enterance\",\n           \"x\": -200,\n           \"y\": 180\n         }\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you receive clear instructions for navigating from the Micwae's back to the E5 Enterance.",
