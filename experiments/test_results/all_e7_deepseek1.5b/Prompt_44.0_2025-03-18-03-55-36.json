    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to this query. The user provided a detailed prompt about matching waypoints and executing actions based on that. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the example given was about navigating through two waypoints: C&D - Coffee Area and RoboHub Entrance. The response involved using navigate for each and then waiting. So I need to make sure my system can handle commands that involve multiple steps.\n\nThe user's prompt says they want to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. Looking at the available waypoints, there are specific ones listed. Let me check:\n\n- E5 Entrance: That's already a waypoint named \"E5 Entrance\". Wait, actually, in the provided list, I don't see an entry for E5 Entrance. Hmm, that might be a typo or maybe it's part of another name.\n\nWait, looking back, no, there isn't an explicit E5 Entrance. The nearest is \"Ea\" which has other words like \"Ea\", \"Enc\", etc., but not sure if that refers to E5.\n\nBut the Micawaves are listed as a waypoint named \"Micawaves\". So I need to check if that's a valid waypoint. From the prompt, there's an entry for \"Micawaves\" which is probably correct.\n\nSo the user wants me to navigate first to the E5 Entrance and then find the Micawaves. But since there's no E5 Entrance in the known waypoints, how do I handle that? Maybe it refers to a specific room or area within the building, but without an explicit waypoint for it, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, looking at the available waypoints again: the user didn't mention E5 Entrance. The provided list includes \"Ea\" which is a different entity. So perhaps that's a mistake. Or maybe it's meant to navigate through other areas before reaching the Micawaves room.\n\nAlternatively, if E5 Entrance isn't a known waypoint, I might need to suggest starting from the previous location or restarting. But in the examples, they started from (0,0) and navigated as needed.\n\nWait, but since the user mentioned \"travel to the E5 Entrance\", and it's not present, maybe the system needs to either recognize that it can't find a waypoint for E5 Entrance and suggest an alternative or ask for clarification. But looking at the instructions, I should follow the given available waypoints without adding new ones.\n\nSince there's no waypoint named \"E5 Entrance\", but only \"Micawaves\", perhaps the user is trying to navigate first to a room that isn't explicitly listed, so maybe it requires restarting from the starting location or navigating through other areas.\n\nBut in the provided examples, when they navigate, they don't have to worry about E5 Entrance because it's not part of their known waypoints. So if \"E5 Entrance\" isn't present, I can skip it and proceed with Micawaves directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant something else. Let me check the waypoint names again:\n\nLooking at the provided list:\n- shower A is a waypoint.\n- micawaves (as in \"Micawaves\") is a waypoint named that.\n- E5 Entrance isn't listed; perhaps it's an invalid term and needs to be handled differently.\n\nIn the instructions, step 3 says tokenization. So I should first normalize by converting both input and known waypoints to lowercase, then check for any building codes or non-essential prefixes, like \"Washroom\" which contains letters and numbers? Wait, no, words are split into tokens; maybe \"Washroom\" is a separate word.\n\nWait, looking at the waypoint names:\n- shower A is just a token.\n- micawaves is one word.\n- E5 Entrance: that's not in the list. So perhaps the system can't find it and should suggest that it needs more information or is invalid.\n\nBut wait, let me check if \"Ea\" is part of any known waypoint. In the provided list, no, there's a \"Enc\" which stands for Enclosure but isn't a waypoint. There's an \"Enclosed\" room but not \"Enc E5 Entrance\". So probably, it's invalid.\n\nSo in this case, the user's request to travel to E5 Entrance is incorrect or missing a known waypoint. Therefore, I should output that it doesn't exist and suggest starting from (0,0).\n\nWait, but the user might have meant something else, like navigating through another area before getting to the Micawaves room.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Ea\" refers to Enclosure 5, which is a specific building or room. But without seeing that in the list, it's hard to say.\n\nBut since the provided waypoint names don't include E5 Entrance, and only have micawaves, I think the best approach is to assume that the user made an error in specifying \"E5 Entrance\" because it's not a known waypoint.\n\nSo the response should be: \"Cannot find an entry for 'Ea' E5 Entrance. Please navigate from (0,0) or restart.\"\n\nBut wait, looking back at the provided waypoint names:\n\n- micawaves is present as a waypoint.\n- Enclosure 1 is listed but not sure if that's relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant \"Enclosed\" instead of \"Ea\", which might be a different entity. But without clear information, I think it's best to follow what's given and state that E5 Entrance isn't a known waypoint.\n</think>\n\nSince \"Ea\" is not a valid waypoint listed in the provided list, we cannot navigate directly to \"Ea E5 Entrance\". Therefore, we should suggest starting from (0,0) or restarting.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Normalization:** Convert both input and known waypoints to lowercase.\n2. **Tokenization:** Split into individual tokens.\n3. **Building Code Check:** Ensure no building codes are present that could be non-essential prefixes.\n4. **Word Lookup:** Look for waypoint names as listed in the provided list.\n5. **Query Processing:**\n   - For \"Ea E5 Entrance\": It is not a known waypoint, so it cannot be navigated to directly.\n   - For \"Enclosed\" (if that's intended): Check if Enclosed 1 or similar exists.\n   - For \"Micawaves\": Lookup if Micawaves is present.\n\n6. **Action Execution:**\n   - Since E5 Entrance is not a known waypoint, the response should indicate that it cannot be found and suggest starting from (0,0) or restarting.\n\n**Final Response:** Cannot find an entry for 'Ea' E5 Entrance.
