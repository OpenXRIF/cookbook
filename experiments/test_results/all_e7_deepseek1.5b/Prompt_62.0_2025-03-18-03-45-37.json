    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me start by breaking down the steps based on the provided guidelines.\n\nFirst, the normalization step. Both the user's input and each waypoint name need to be converted to lowercase. So, the request becomes \"take me to the e7 silent study.\" And the waypoint names are like \"E7 Silent Study\" which I assume is already in lowercase but might have a capital S at the end.\n\nNext, extraneous tokens removal. Looking at the user's input, there are no such tokens that contain both letters and digits at the beginning of the string. So that step doesn't apply here.\n\nTokenization involves splitting both the normalized input and the known waypoint name into individual words. The normalized input is \"take me to the e7 silent study.\" Splitting this gives: [\"take\", \"me\", \"to\", \"the\", \"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\"]. The waypoint name \"E7 Silent Study\" would split into [\"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\"].\n\nNow, similarity calculation. For each known waypoint, I need to check if all its tokens are present in the user's input. If a waypoint has some tokens that aren't in the input and others that are missing, it doesn't match unless most of the tokens are covered.\n\nLooking at \"E7 Silent Study\", which is probably an actual waypoint. The keywords here are e7 (probably the zone number), silent, and study. Checking against the user's input: take me to [e7], silent, study. So yes, all three words are present in order. That seems like a strong match.\n\nSince this waypoints meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, I treat it as a match. There's only one waypoint that matches, so I don't need to check for multiple options.\n\nAccording to the handling of complex commands section, since the request is straightforward without needing multiple steps, I output the actions in the order they should be executed: navigate first because the user wants to go to the study area, then wait when they finish. No speak or other functions needed here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the response will have two actions: \"navigate\" and \"wait\", each with their respective inputs as specified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E7 Silent Study\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 20\n        }\n    ]\n}",
