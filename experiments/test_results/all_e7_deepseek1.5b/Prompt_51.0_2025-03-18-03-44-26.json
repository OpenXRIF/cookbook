    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to handle this prompt. The user wants me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Micawaves. I remember from the previous examples that each waypoint needs to be matched against known ones using a fuzzy matching system.\n\nFirst, I'll need to normalize both the input prompt and the waypoint names to lowercase. So, \"E5 Entrance\" becomes \"e5 entrance\", and \"Micawaves\" is already in lowercase. Then, I remove any tokens at the beginning that don't seem relevant. For example, if a token like \"room\" or something else appears first, it's probably irrelevant.\n\nNext, I'll split both the normalized prompt and each known waypoint into individual words. The normalized prompt would be [\"travel\", \"to\", \"the\", \"e5\", \"entrance\"], and the known waypoints are \"E5 Entrance\" (which is already known) and \"Micawaves\" which hasn't been processed yet.\n\nNow, I'll compare each waypoint with the normalized prompt. For \"E5 Entrance\", checking if all its tokens (\"e5 entrance\") appear in the normalized prompt (\"travel to e5 entrance\"). That's a match because both words have \"entrance\" and \"e5\". So this should be selected as a match.\n\nFor \"Micawaves\", I'll split into [\"micawaves\"] and check against [\"travel\", \"to\", \"the\", \"micawaves\"]. The waypoint is currently unknown, so the similarity would probably be low. If no known waypoint matches, then the function would fallback to just \"speak\" with an action message saying it's invalid.\n\nSo, in this case, since both known waypoints are either matched or not, I'll select \"E5 Entrance\" as a match and use that for navigation.\n</think>\n\nI will process your request step by step using the fuzzy matching system outlined above:\n\n1. **Normalization:**\n   - User Input: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Micawaves.\"\n   - Known Waypoints:\n     1. \"E5 Entrance\"\n     2. \"Micawaves\"\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:**\n   - Both the normalized user input and each known waypoint are split into individual words.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n   - User Input (normalized): [\"travel\", \"to\", \"the\", \"e5\", \"entrance\"]\n   - Known Waypoints:\n     1. \"E5 Entrance\"\n     2. \"Micawaves\"\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n   - For each known waypoint, check if all its tokens appear in the normalized user input.\n   - \"E5 Entrance\": Contains \"e5\" and \"entrance\", both present in the normalized input.\n   - \"Micawaves\": Contains only \"micawaves\"; not present in the normalized input.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n   - Since \"E5 Entrance\" meets the similarity threshold, it is selected as a match.\n   - If no waypoint matches, fallback to \"speak\" with an error message.\n\n**Result:**\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n          \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n          \"x\": 0.0,\n          \"y\": 0.0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
