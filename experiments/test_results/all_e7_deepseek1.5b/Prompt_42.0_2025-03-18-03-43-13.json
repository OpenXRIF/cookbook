    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints and their names, I see E7 Silent Study. That seems relevant because the user is asking to take someone else to an E7 area. The name directly refers to the waypoint they provided.\n\nLooking at the normalization rules, both parts of the user's prompt (the input) and each known waypoint name have been converted to lowercase. So, \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" becomes \"take me to the e7 silent study.\" And each known waypoint like speak, navigate, wait, etc., are already in lowercase, so that checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check if any of the known waypoints match the waypoint name. Scanning through the list, yes, there's an E7 Silent Study waypoint with the name \"e7 silent study.\" That should be a match.\n\nThe similarity calculation part says we look for all tokens in the waypoint name and ensure they're present in the user's input. Since the waypoint is exactly the same as the normalized version of the user's prompt, it meets or exceeds the threshold.\n\nSince one waypoint matches perfectly, I can select that action without any issues. No ambiguity here because there's only one known match.\n\nSo, my plan is to use the \"navigate\" function with the name e7 silent study and input coordinates 100, 100 as appropriate. But wait, where are those coordinates? The user didn't provide them. Hmm, but in this case, since we have a waypoint that's exactly matching, I can still proceed without needing to adjust inputs.\n\nTherefore, the response should be straightforward\u2014navigate to E7 Silent Study using their coordinates.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E7 - Silent Study\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
