For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

Conclude your patrol at the East Entrance and report any unusual findings.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user wants me to create a series of actions for speech-to-text processing. First, I need to understand what each command entails.\n\nThe prompt starts with \"Robot, begin security patrol...\" This seems like a specific task involving security, so the action should be navigate. The location mentioned is E5 Entrance. So, I'll have to go directly there and speak there.\n\nNext part: ensure no unauthorized access. That reinforces that it's about navigating securely, which fits under the same \"navigate\" function.\n\nThen, move to the \"Temporary Booth\". Again, this is a specific location, so another navigate action at that spot.\n\nCheck for unattended items, which might involve verifying permissions or something related, but since I'm just following instructions, maybe it's about ensuring security measures are in place. I'll again use navigate here, perhaps pointing to the booth.\n\nProceeding to the Elevators: navigate there and verify functionality.\n\nMonitor activity at the \"Novelties\" section\u2014navigate there for that location.\n\nConclude patrol at the East Entrance and report findings. So, end with navigating back to E5 and then reporting.\n\nFinally, any unusual findings require a speak action to inform the user about it.\n\nI need to make sure each action is specific and within the functions allowed: navigate, speak, wait. Also, check if I'm using the waypoint names correctly from the available list. For security patrol, maybe it's under another function, but since the prompt doesn't mention it, perhaps it's outside any known waypoint. But the user didn't specify, so I have to include each instruction separately.\n\nWait, the first step was \"Robot,\" which might be a typo for navigate or movement, but in this case, it clearly refers to security patrol. So I'll adjust that part to just navigate as that's the primary action here.\n\nI should also ensure that all commands are processed left-to-right without considering other functions unless specified otherwise. Each step is a separate action, so I can't combine them into one command like in the examples provided.\n\nI think that covers everything. Now, let me outline each action clearly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 0.0,\n                \"y\": 0.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Temporary Booth\",\n                \"x\": 100.0,\n                \"y\": 100.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 300.0,\n                \"y\": 200.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 250.0,\n                \"y\": 150.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 600.0,\n                \"y\": 300.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"You may be authorized to proceed.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 900.0,\n                \"y\": 400.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Thank you for your support.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"East Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 1200.0,\n                \"y\": 500.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\", // This action is added as an example, but in the actual response, it would be 'Support your patrol'\n            \"input\": \"We will inform you about any unusual findings during your patrol.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
