For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query about taking them to the E7 silent study. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are a list of waypoints provided, each with their own location and description. The user is asking for something specific: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" \n\nLet me go through the waypoint details again to see if any of them match this request. Hmm... The waypoint named \"E7 silent study\" isn't listed explicitly. So I can't find a direct equivalent.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use another method since there's no direct waypoint for that location. Perhaps I should refer to other waypoints or parts of the map that might lead me there. For example, if there are multiple areas near E7, I could navigate to each and see which is the silent study area.\n\nAlso, considering the support functions, if I can't find a waypoint directly, maybe using \"navigate\" commands from different locations would help. But without knowing where exactly E7 silent study is, that might not be straightforward.\n\nI should also think about how the navigation works. If I take a left turn or something, could it lead me to the right place? Or perhaps I need to use some specific functions like \"speak\" to ask for directions if there's ambiguity.\n\nAnother thing is handling ambiguities. The user might not have enough details to decide on the exact location. So maybe I should include an option to speak and request further instructions or check available waypoints.\n\nPutting it all together, my response should guide the user through possible navigation paths if they're unsure about E7 silent study's location. Maybe suggest using \"navigate\" from nearby areas or use a fallback command when no direct waypoint is found.\n\nI think that covers everything. Now I'll structure this into clear actions and instructions.\n</think>\n\nBased on your query, it seems you are looking for a way to navigate to the E7 silent study. Since there isn't a waypoint named \"E7 silent study\" in our list, we can either:\n\n1. Use the navigation commands from other nearby areas if available.\n2. Include an option to speak and request further instructions or check for another waypoint.\n\nHere's how I'd approach it:\n\n- First, navigate to any nearby area that might lead you closer.\n- If no direct command is found, ask for further instructions or confirm your location.\n\nThis way, we handle the ambiguity by providing options for navigation or additional help.",
