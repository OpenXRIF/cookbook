    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided a bunch of information about different waypoints and some examples. They've also given specific instructions on handling fuzzy matching when looking up waypoints based on user prompts.\n\nSo, the task is to process a prompt like \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Also, Go to the C&D\" using the provided system. I need to break down what this means and how to translate it into actions that the system can perform.\n\nFirst, let's parse the user prompt. It seems they're asking two things: figuring out how many entrances are near \"E7\" and then going to the \"C&D\" area. The first part is a query about locations related to E7, which likely refers to an entrance on the edge of E7.\n\nI know that each waypoint has a name, a location (X,Y), and functions like Navigate, speak, wait. The normalized step ensures both input and waypoints are lowercase. Extraneous tokens are removed based on building codes or being at the start.\n\nThe first part is about counting entrances near \"E7\". So I need to look through all known waypoints that either mention E7 or have E7 in their names. Once I find those, I can extract their locations and count them.\n\nBut wait, do any of the provided waypoints mention E7? Let me check:\n\nLooking at each waypoint:\n- The first is \"E7\", so that's a direct match.\nThen there are other entries like \"Coffee Road\", but not specifically mentioning E7. Wait, no, looking back, I see in the normalization steps, after removing non-essential tokens (like numbers or letters without context), perhaps certain tokens can be removed if they're at the start.\n\nBut in this case, maybe the \"E7\" itself is the way to go. So I think \"E7 - Coffee Area\" would match \"E7\", so count it as one entrance.\n\nThen for the second part, going to C&D. From the normalization steps, since both are lowercase and no extraneous tokens, just checking if they exist in the known list. So C&D is another waypoint name, so that's a direct match.\n\nTherefore, I need to select these two waypoints: \"E7 - Coffee Area\" with location 0,0 and \"C&D - Coffee Area\", also at 0,0. Wait, but both are named \"Coffee Area\"? That might be confusing. But assuming each has its own location. If the user wants multiple locations, that could complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe I need to extract each waypoint's name, check if it contains the keyword related to E7, and then pick the closest match. Alternatively, perhaps just using a search on \"E7\" in any part of the waypoint names.\n\nLooking at the provided list:\n\n- The first is \"E7\", so that's one.\n- Other entries include \"Coffee Road\", which might relate to E7 if it's on the edge? Not sure. Maybe not directly relevant, but perhaps a nearby entrance.\n\nWait, but \"E7\" in the waypoint name would be the direct match for querying how many entrances are near E7. Then, going to C&D is another straightforward action.\n\nSo I think the actions should be navigate to each of these waypoints, and speak to ask about the number of entrances if needed. But since the user just wants a general count, maybe it's enough to select those two locations.\n\nBut perhaps there are more waypoints that relate to E7 or have E7 in their names. Let me check again:\n\n- The waypoint \"Coffee Road\" is at 100,100. Is that near E7? Maybe not directly. So the only direct match would be \"E7 - Coffee Area\".\n\nSo I think the system should output actions to navigate to both \"E7 - Coffee Area\" and \"C&D - Coffee Area\". But if these have the same name, perhaps it's a single entry.\n\nWait, no, looking at the waypoint list again:\n\nYes, there are two entries with \"Coffee Road\":\n- E7\n- Coffee Road\n\nSo that would be two entrances. So I need to navigate to each of them separately or combine them in one action if possible.\n\nHmm, but navigating might require specifying both locations, which could take longer and perhaps isn't efficient for a simple count request. Alternatively, just selecting both as separate actions.\n\nBut the user prompt is \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7\", so maybe they want all nearby E7-based areas or something like that. If \"Coffee Road\" is near E7, then it's two entrances. Otherwise, one if only \"E7 - Coffee Area\" exists.\n\nWait, but \"E7\" alone might be a single entrance, and \"Coffee Road\" could be another nearby. So in total, two entrances.\n\nSo I think the system should output navigate to both \"E7 - Coffee Area\" and \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\", assuming they are separate locations. Or maybe select all E7-based waypoints and count them.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a way to collect all E7-related waypoints into one action for counting, that would be better. But perhaps the user just wants two different areas.\n\nIn any case, I think the system should navigate to \"E7 - Coffee Area\" and \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\", assuming they are separate locations. If they're not, then maybe select all E7-based waypoints.\n\nBut since both are named \"Coffee Area\", it might be better to check if there's a general name like \"Coffee Road\" or similar related to E7 elsewhere in the list.\n\nLooking back, I don't see any other waypoint names that directly relate to E7. So perhaps only navigate to \"E7 - Coffee Area\".\n\nBut then the user also mentions going to C&D. So maybe both actions are needed: one for counting entrances near E7 and another for navigating to C&D.\n\nWait, but in the prompt, it's just asking how many entrances there are to E7. So perhaps the system should select all E7-based areas and count them, even if they have the same name. But that might not be ideal as it would create duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, since \"E7\" is a waypoint on its own, maybe that counts as one entrance, and \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\" counts as another, making two in total.\n\nSo the system should output navigate to both \"E7 - Coffee Area\" and \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\", perhaps with an action like navigate or select multiple locations if possible. But given the data, it's likely that these are separate entries.\n\nAlternatively, if there are multiple E7-based areas, they might be listed as a list of waypoints, but in this case, only two: \"E7\" and \"Coffee Road\".\n\nSo I think the system should handle each separately. If both have similar names or different names, it should navigate to each accordingly.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, the system will perform the following actions:\n\n1. Navigate to \"E7 - Coffee Area\".\n2. Navigate to \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\" (assuming this is another nearby area related to E7).\n\nThese two locations are selected because they are the only E7-related entries in the provided list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Normalization and Search:**\n   - The user's prompt is \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Also, Go to the C&D\".\n   - Normalize both input and waypoints by removing non-essential tokens (like numbers at the start).\n   - Use a search for \"E7\" in any part of the waypoint names or locations.\n\n2. **Keyword Matching:**\n   - Identify waypoints containing \"Coffee Road\" or directly named \"E7\".\n   - The waypoint list shows two entries related to E7: \"E7 - Coffee Area\" and \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\".\n\n3. **Action Selection:**\n   - Navigate to \"E7 - Coffee Area\".\n   - Navigate to \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\".\n\nThese actions fulfill the user's query about the number of entrances near E7, although in this case, only two separate areas are selected.\n\n**Final Actions:**\n\n1. Navigate to \"E7 - Coffee Area\".\n2. Navigate to \"Coffee Road - Coffee Area\".",
