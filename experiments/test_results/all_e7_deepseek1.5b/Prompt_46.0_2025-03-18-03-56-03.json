    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The task is to provide a set of actions based on the given guidelines for matching waypoints. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. The user wants to travel from their starting location (0,0) to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. I should check if there are any known waypoints that match this journey.\n\nLooking at the available waypoint names:\n\n1. **navigate**: This function takes a waypoint name and an input location. So it's probably for moving between points.\n2. **speak**: This is for asking or giving commands.\n3. **wait**: This lets me wait until certain conditions are met.\n\nNow, I need to see which waypoints relate to the journey described. The key here seems to be the E5 Entrance and Microwaves.\n\nI remember from the prompt that there's a waypoint named \"E5 Entrance\". Let me check if this is on the list of known waypoints. Yes, in the provided data, under the shower A section, I see \"E5 Entrance\" as a waypoint name. So it should be recognized.\n\nNext, what about Microwaves? The available waypoint for Microwaves isn't explicitly mentioned here. Wait, looking back, there's a shower A section where I do find a waypoint called \"Microwaves\", but that's an older version from 2019. However, in the current list (since the latest data ends around 2023), I don't see a Microwaves waypoint. So it might be missing.\n\nThis could cause a problem because if Microwaves isn't recognized, the system won't know where to find them after entering the E5 Entrance. But wait, let me double-check the latest data provided in the initial prompt.\n\nIn the advanced fuzzy matching for waypoint names, the available waypoint names are:\n\n- E5 Entrance (yes)\n- shower A (but that's an older name; probably not present now)\n- shower B\n- Shower C\n- Microwaves\n- etc.\nWait, no. The list is: \n\n[\n  \"E5 Entrance\",\n  \"shower A\",\n  \"shower B\",\n  \"shower C\",\n  ... others,\n]\n\nNo \"Microwaves\" is listed in the current data. So the system doesn't recognize Microwaves as a waypoint.\n\nThis means that when the user asks to find the Microwaves, they might not be able to because there's no known waypoint for it. So the system should output an action indicating that this specific command isn't supported.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. The E5 Entrance is recognized and can be navigated to.\n2. From there, a \"navigate\" action would target the Microwaves' waypoint if available, but since it's not present in the current list, I need to handle that case.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014looking back at the advanced fuzzy matching for Waypoints section:\n\nThe user prompt mentions shower A and shower B from 2019. But in the latest data provided (since October 2023), the microwaves waypoint isn't present. So it's safe to assume that the microwaves function is not listed.\n\nTherefore, during the process of matching, when checking for \"Microwaves\", if none match the similarity threshold, the system should recognize that command as unsupported and output an action with the message: \"Unsupported action requested\".\n\nSo, in this case, after navigating to E5 Entrance, the user might want to find Microwaves. Since there's no waypoint named Microwaves, the system will respond by saying the action is \"speak\" and inputting that it doesn't exist.\n\nWait a second\u2014did I miss anything? Let me review:\n\n- The user prompt uses the correct functions.\n- It processes commands in order: navigate, speak, wait.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, it selects the one with the highest similarity.\n- In this case, Microwaves isn't recognized, so \"speak\" is triggered.\n\nI think that's solid. So the final actions would be navigating to E5 Entrance and then attempting to find Microwaves, which is not supported. Hence, an error message is appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 616\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid command: 'Microwaves' is not recognized\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
