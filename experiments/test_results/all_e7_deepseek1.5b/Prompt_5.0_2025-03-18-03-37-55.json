    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has given me a bunch of information about different waypoints and their locations, along with some rules for matching them based on user prompts. They want me to respond to a query that tells me where to go next after the RoboHub.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. There are several waypoints listed with names like \"C&D - Coffee Area\", \"C&D - Coffee Room\", and so on. Each has coordinates in X and Y. The user prompt is a bit vague, but it seems they want me to move to the RoboHub first and then proceed to Silent Study.\n\nLooking at the waypoint definitions, I see that \"RoboHub\" is listed as a waypoint with coordinates (25, 140). So, if the user requests moving to the RoboHub, I should navigate there. But what about Silent Study? It doesn't appear in the available list, so I can't do anything with it.\n\nI also need to follow the fuzzy matching rules as outlined. First, normalize both inputs and waypoint names by converting to lowercase. Then remove extraneous tokens like those containing letters and digits at the beginning. Splitting into words helps compare each part of the user's prompt against the waypoints.\n\nThe user's command is \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study.\" The first part, \"Move to the RoboHub,\" matches exactly with the waypoint at (25,140). That's straightforward. The second part, \"proceed to the Silent Study,\" seems out of the known waypoints provided. Since \"Silent Study\" isn't a valid waypoint, I can't navigate there.\n\nSo, the plan is: move to RoboHub, wait for it, and then since I can't go to Silent Study, just acknowledge that action and maybe include any other actions needed based on the original prompt.\n\nI should structure this as an action array with \"navigate\" for RoboHub and handle the next step. Since there's nothing else, I don't need a wait or speak action here because the user didn't ask to move anywhere else except where the Silent Study is unknown.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 140\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"The Silent Study is unknown, so I cannot proceed.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
