    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a detailed prompt about handling commands with waypoints and various functions like Navigate, speak, and wait. They also gave examples of how the output should look.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the task is. It seems like the goal is to process a command that includes multiple waypoints or actions in sequence. Each waypoint can be located using an input that might not match exactly but still refer to it from elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the user's prompt again, when matching waypoints, there are specific steps involved: normalization, removal of extraneous tokens, tokenization, similarity calculation based on presence and frequency of tokens, selection if a waypoint is matched, fallback otherwise. Also, handling complex commands with multiple actions in order.\n\nNow, focusing on the example given by the user where they want to \"pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub.\" The output is twonavigate actions: one for C&D Coffee Area and another for RoboHub Entrance. So, it seems like each action is handled separately.\n\nBut in this case, the query is a single command that's broken into multiple steps. Let me see if I can apply similar logic here. The user's final prompt is \"Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\"\n\nWait, actually, looking at their last example: \"Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" But in the previous examples, each step was a separate action.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, I have to process the command as a sequence of waypoints or actions. So here, it's two actions: going to the North Entrance (a waypoint) and then saying \"North Entrance\" (another function). But wait, is that correct?\n\nHold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. In their last prompt, they just say \"proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" But in the problem statement, each command's output includes a list of actions. So for this query, it would be two separate commands: one to go to the North Entrance and another to speak.\n\nWait, but that might not make sense because you can't just process two different waypoints in a single prompt. Perhaps I'm supposed to treat \"proceed to North Entrance\" as an action and then \"speak 'North Entrance' out loud\" as another.\n\nBut in the problem's examples, each command is broken into multiple actions with separate inputs. So for this query, it would be two separate speak actions: one for proceeding to North Entrance and another for saying that phrase.\n\nWait, but how do I handle \"proceed to North Entrance\"? It might not be a waypoint, so maybe the output is just a speak action indicating that.\n\nBut in the problem's understanding of user prompts, when matching waypoints, if a command includes multiple steps, it might involve multiple actions. So for this query, perhaps it's two separate commands: one to go to North Entrance and another to speak.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"proceed to North Entrance\" is treated as an action, and then you just say the phrase in another action.\n\nI think I need to structure it so that each part of the command is processed. So first, moving to North Entrance (a waypoint), which might involve checking if that's a valid waypoint. If not, output \"This waypoint does not exist.\" Then, saying \"North Entrance\" out loud, which would be another speak action.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, starting locations are 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0. So maybe moving from the starting location to the North Entrance is a navigate command? Or perhaps it's two actions: navigate to North Entrance and then say 'North Entrance'.\n\nWait, but in the last example given by the user, they had a speak action with an input of \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So if I need to process this query, I think it would be:\n\n1. Check if the command contains a valid waypoint. Here, there are two parts: proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance'. The first part is not a waypoint, so output the speak action for that.\n\nBut then, the second part is a simple phrase, which might just be a speak action as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should process each action in order. So first, move from starting location (0,0) to North Entrance. Then, say 'North Entrance' out loud. Both of these would be navigate commands if applicable.\n\nWait, but the example given by the user had two actions: going to C&D and then to RoboHub. Each was a separate command with a waypoint name or an input string.\n\nIn this case, the query is about \"proceeding\" which might just involve navigating, not necessarily to a waypoint. So perhaps it's a single command: navigate to North Entrance. Then another command: say 'North Entrance' out loud.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, each command is broken into multiple actions with separate inputs. So for this query, two commands would result in four actions in total? That seems odd.\n\nWait, no. Maybe the entire query is processed as a single command, but split into multiple parts. For example:\n\n1. \"proceeding to North Entrance\"\n2. \"say 'North Entrance' out loud\"\n\nBut each of these might be separate commands, resulting in two speak actions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's not allowed for a single command to have two separate parts like that. It seems more likely that the entire query is considered one command: navigate to North Entrance and then say 'North Entrance'.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure of the processing, it's hard to tell. Perhaps I should just follow the problem statement's understanding and see how it would apply.\n\nLooking back, when a user wants to process a command with multiple waypoints or actions, each is handled as separate inputs in the output. So for this query:\n\n- \"proceeding to North Entrance\" might be considered an action (navigate), but if it doesn't correspond to a waypoint, perhaps it's treated as another speak.\n\nBut since the first part isn't a waypoint, maybe just output the speak action for proceeding to North Entrance.\n\nWait, no. The problem's user prompt says that in some examples, they process a command with multiple parts by having separate inputs. So each action is processed separately.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n1. Process \"proceeding to North Entrance\" as a navigate from starting location (0,0) to North Entrance. If it exists, output the result; if not, output nothing or indicate existence.\n\n2. Then process \"say 'North Entrance' out loud.\" Again, check if that's a valid phrase or keyword. It seems more likely a simple speak action with the input as is.\n\nBut in the problem statement's examples, each command is processed separately, so perhaps this query would result in two separate commands: one to navigate to North Entrance and another to say 'North Entrance'.\n\nWait, but how does it fit into the example given by the user? The last example was a single query that resulted in multiple actions. So maybe this is similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"proceeding\" isn't an action at all; it's just part of a phrase. But then, it would be processed as a single input string, which might require determining if it's a keyword or something else.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't cover that. It only covers commands with waypoints or functions. So perhaps \"proceeding\" is treated as a way to move from the starting location to North Entrance, and then another command for saying the phrase.\n\nBut without knowing how moving works in terms of the processing, it's tricky. Maybe I should assume that the entire query is considered a single command: navigate from starting location (0,0) to North Entrance, and then say 'North Entrance'.\n\nSo, as per the problem statement:\n\n1. Check if \"proceeding to North Entrance\" corresponds to a valid action or keyword.\n\nIf it's a waypoint, retrieve its result. If not, output nothing for that part.\n\n2. Then process \"say 'North Entrance' out loud,\" which is another function call. Retrieve that and output the result.\n\nBut perhaps the query should be split into two separate commands: one to navigate to North Entrance and another to say the phrase.\n\nIn terms of how to present this, it would require specifying each action separately in the output list.\n\nSo, putting it all together, for the given query:\n\n- First, process \"proceeding to North Entrance\": if it's a valid waypoint, retrieve its result. If not, output nothing or indicate existence.\n- Then, process \"say 'North Entrance' out loud\": check if that's a keyword or function and retrieve accordingly.\n\nThus, the output would be two speak actions: one for navigating to North Entrance and another for saying the phrase.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how moving is handled. It might just require checking if the location can be reached from starting position, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the problem statement, each part of the query would need to be processed as separate commands. So \"proceeding\" and \"say 'North Entrance' out loud\" would both be actions, each resulting in a speak action if applicable.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown for processing your last example:\n\n1. **Check if \"proceeding to North Entrance\" corresponds to a valid action or keyword.**\n   - It does not exist as a waypoint or function, so output nothing.\n\n2. **Process \"say 'North Entrance' out loud.\"**\n   - This is a simple phrase, so retrieve and output it.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n- For the first part (proceeding to North Entrance):  \n  Result: Nothing exists for \"proceeding to North Entrance.\"\n\n- For the second part (\"say 'North Entrance' out loud\"):  \n  Result: The phrase \"North Entrance\" is retrieved and outputs as specified.",
