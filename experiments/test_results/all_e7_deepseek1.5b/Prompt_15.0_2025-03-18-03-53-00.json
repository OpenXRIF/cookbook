    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this query. The user wants to take some actions: shower A and shower B, pause for a minute at shower B, and then go. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements. They provided a list of waypoint names, which are specific locations or places that can be navigated to. The functions available are navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nLooking at the user's prompt, they're asking about taking showers A and B and waiting, but showering isn't directly listed as a waypoint. So, I need to see if there's a waypoint named shower A or shower B in the provided list.\n\nWait, checking the waypoint names: shower is not among them. That means the user's request can't be matched with any known waypoints. \n\nSo, per the guidelines, if no known waypoint matches, the output should be an action that says \"speak\" and includes the message \"Unsupported action requested.\" This makes sense because they're trying to reach a specific place but it doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to ensure that other edge cases are handled, like invalid commands or unsupported actions. In this case, since the request is about a place without a waypoint, it falls into the unsupported action category.\n\nTherefore, I should structure the response to speak with the appropriate message and include the specific message about the unknown action.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
