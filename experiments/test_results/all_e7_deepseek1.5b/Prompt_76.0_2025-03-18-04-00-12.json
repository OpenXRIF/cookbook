    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, the user provided a detailed prompt about their query system, which has some specific rules for matching waypoints and handling commands. I need to understand each part of this to build the system correctly.\n\nFirst, looking at the prompt, it's pretty structured with examples and rules. The main goal is to create an AI that can perform certain actions based on a user's input, especially related to navigating through zones or ensuring security patrols. \n\nThe first thing I notice is the normalization step where both the user's input and each waypoint name are converted to lowercase. That makes sense because it standardizes the case insensitivity of both inputs. So, whether the user types \"Coffee Area\" or \"coffee Area,\" they're treated equally.\n\nNext, there's an extraneous token removal step. This is crucial because if a token like \"123\" appears at the beginning of an input, it should be discarded. For example, in one of the examples, the user prompt includes \"100\" as part of their input, which isn't supposed to be there. So, we have to make sure that any tokens that don't fit the context are removed.\n\nTokenization follows this by splitting both the cleaned input and each waypoint name into individual words. This is essential for comparing the two since word order matters in commands like navigating through zones. \n\nMoving on to similarity calculation, it's a bit more complex. The system needs to check if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input. Alternatively, ensuring that at least 80% of the tokens are present is a good fallback method. This allows for some flexibility without missing out on potential matches. \n\nThe selection and fallback steps come next. If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, it's selected as the match. If multiple waypoints do, the highest similarity score is chosen to prioritize better matches. If none meet the criteria, an action is taken that says \"speak\" with an error message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nHandling complex commands is another important aspect. The system processes commands in a left-to-right sequence unless specified otherwise. This means that each command should be addressed before moving on to the next part of the instruction. Also, for multi-step commands, specific actions are output in order. If multiple interpretations could apply, the one that minimizes backtracking is chosen.\n\nNow, looking at the supported edge cases: if a waypoint isn't found, it returns an action saying \"speak\" with an error message. If an unsupported action is requested beyond navigate, speak, or wait, it also outputs another speak action but says the action wasn't supported.\n\nThe examples provided are helpful. The first example involves picking up something and dropping it off at a destination, using waypoint names. The second example has multiple steps: asking for keys, waiting, navigating to a building, etc. The third example is an invalid request about an unknown waypoint.\n\nTo handle these cases in the system, I need to implement each rule carefully. For normalization and tokenization, using regular expressions can help split tokens correctly while ignoring case variations. For similarity matching, both exact matches and partial matches based on percentage thresholds are necessary. \n\nI also think about error handling for undefined waypoints and unsupported actions. If a waypoint isn't found in the known list, it should trigger an \"speak\" action with an error message. If any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is called, another speak action is triggered but says that the action wasn't supported.\n\nNow, thinking about how to structure this in code. It might involve parsing user input into tokens, normalizing both the input and known waypoints, splitting them into words, and then performing a similarity check for each waypoint. If any waypoint matches sufficiently, it's selected as the primary action. \n\nBut wait, the user prompt also mentions handling complex commands where actions are in sequence. So, I need to make sure that commands like \"go to E5 Entrance\" come before checking for unauthorized access. That means processing each command part by part and only moving forward once a step is completed.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that some waypoint names might have the same tokens but different contexts. For example, if both \"Coffee Area\" and \"coffee Zone\" could be interpreted as similar zones, I need to prioritize the more specific one, maybe? Or does it matter in this system since they are just waypoint names?\n\nAlso, regarding edge cases, handling invalid or ambiguous commands by outputting a speak action with an error makes sense. So, if the user inputs something that doesn't fit any known command parts, the system assumes there's no valid action.\n\nPutting all these thoughts together, I can outline the steps for the system:\n\n1. **Normalize and Preprocess Input:**\n   - Convert input to lowercase.\n   - Remove extraneous tokens (like building codes) from both user input and known waypoints.\n\n2. **Tokenize:**\n   - Split normalized input into words.\n   - Same with each waypoint name.\n\n3. **Similarity Check for Each Waypoint:**\n   - For each waypoint, check if all its tokens are present in the normalized input or meet at least 80% presence.\n   - Record the similarity score (number of matching tokens / total tokens).\n\n4. **Select the Best Waypoint:**\n   - Among all waypoints that meet the threshold, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n\n5. **Generate Action Based on Waypoint Match:**\n   - Output an action to navigate through the zone.\n   - Provide details about the zones and actions required.\n\n6. **Handle Complex Commands:**\n   - Process each part of the command in order (e.g., go to E32, then check for security).\n   - Ensure that after moving one step, the next command is processed appropriately.\n\n7. **Error Handling for Undefined Waypoints:**\n   - If no waypoint matches, trigger \"speak\" with an error message indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\n8. **Support for Unavailable Actions:**\n   - If any action beyond navigate, speak, or wait is called, output another speak action with an unsupported message.\n\nI think that covers most of the bases. Now, time to outline how this would be implemented in code, considering these steps and possible edge cases.\n</think>\n\nTo address the user's query system requirements, we will outline a structured approach to implement the AI system based on the provided rules and examples.\n\n---\n\n### **System Overview**\nThe AI system is designed to navigate zones (e.g., E12) and perform security actions by selecting appropriate waypoints.
