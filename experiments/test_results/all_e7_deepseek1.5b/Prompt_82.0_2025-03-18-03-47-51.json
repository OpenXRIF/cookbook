    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user has given me a detailed prompt about handling various commands and waypoints, but now they want to handle a specific request: \"Please go to the Dairy Queen?\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's expected here. From the previous examples and guidelines, it looks like when a command is given without specifying actions or waypoint matching, the system should output a speak action with an error message if nothing matches.\n\nSo, breaking down the request: \"Can you go to the Dairy Queen?\". It seems straightforward, but I need to make sure that the query doesn't match any known waypoints. If it does, we return an empty action for speak. \n\nI'll start by normalizing both the input and the waypoint name. The user's input is a sentence, which isn't normalized yet. I'll convert it into lowercase: \"Can you go to the Dairy Queen?\". \n\nNext, I need to check if this query contains any tokens that are not words or building codes. The word \"Dairy\" doesn't have letters and digits at the beginning, so it should be considered a known waypoint name.\n\nLooking up the normalized form of \"Dairy\", I find that the closest entry is \"Dairy Queen\". That seems to match exactly, just with different capitalization. So, there's no need for extra tokens or prefixes; this is a direct match.\n\nNow, according to the guidelines, if a known waypoint exists and matches the input when normalized, we treat it as a match. Since dairy_q corresponds directly to the user's query, it should be handled.\n\nTherefore, the system will respond with an action of \"speak\" since there are no actions beyond speak in this case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Dairy Queen\",\n                \"x\": 0.0,\n                \"y\": 0.0\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
