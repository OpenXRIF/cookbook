    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. The task is to process the command \"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoint names: there's an Action, but no direct waypoint named \"Assembly Room\". So, according to the guidelines, if a known waypoint isn't found, I should output an action with the message \"This waypoint does not exist\".\n\nI should also check if any functions are needed beyond navigate. Since the command is moving and state, it seems like navigating is required. But since there's no valid waypoint named \"Assembly Room\", I'll proceed to the fallback.\n\nThe response should be in JSON format with a single action: speak, and include the input message as \"This waypoint does not exist\". That way, the user knows exactly what to expect for that particular case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
