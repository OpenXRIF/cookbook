    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond when someone says, \"There's no good coffee here. Don't go to the C&D.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the rules provided, the main task is to check if any known waypoint matches the user's query. The user mentioned a C&D area and said not to go there because there's no good coffee. So I should focus on the C&D area as it seems relevant.\n\nLooking through the available waypoints, there are three related ones: Coffee A, Shower A, and Shower B. But the main issue is about the C&D area. None of these waypoints mention \"coffee\" or are specifically about that location except maybe shower A which mentions shower.\n\nWait, no, actually, the C&D zone doesn't have any known waypoint mentioning it in the available list. The closest related ones are Shower A and shower B, but those don't address coffee. So I can't find a direct match for \"coffee\" in the provided waypoints.\n\nSo, since none of the known waypoints mention \"coffee,\" the first step is to look up any other waypoint that might be referring to the C&D area or has something to do with it indirectly. But from what's given, there are no such waypoints.\n\nGiven this situation, I think the appropriate action is to return a speak message indicating that the input doesn't match any known waypoint. This falls under the supported edge cases where the input refers to an unknown waypoint.\n\nI should also consider if any other waypoint mentions \"coffee,\" but since none do, and there's nothing else about C&D except in shower A/B, which don't relate to coffee either, I can't find a match.\n\nTherefore, the response should be that this action does not exist because it refers to an unknown location. This means outputting a speak action with the appropriate message.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: There is no known waypoint for C&D, which appears to refer to a shower area.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
