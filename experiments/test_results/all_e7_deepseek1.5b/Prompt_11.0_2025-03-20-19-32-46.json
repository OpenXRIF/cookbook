For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to process this user prompt. The prompt says, \"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\" Hmm, first, I need to break this down into steps.\n\nFirst, I should probably normalize both parts of the prompt. That means converting everything to lowercase. So it becomes \"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\"\n\nNext, there are extraneous tokens to remove. I need to look for tokens that start with letters and might not be identifiers. In this case, everything seems straightforward, so maybe nothing needs removing.\n\nThen, tokenize both parts. Let's see, \"It's too loud here!\" becomes [\"it's\", \"too\", \"loud\", \"here!\"]. The second part is \"Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\" Tokenizing this gives us [\"let's\", \"go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"Silent\", \"Study,\", \"and\", \"then\", \"afterwards\", \",\", \"we\", \"can\", \"check out\", \"the\", \"RoboHub!\"].\n\nNow, for each waypoint name in the known list, I need to check if all tokens from the input are present. The known waypoints include places like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, Silent Study, etc.\n\nLooking at the first part of the prompt, there's no waypoint named \"It's too loud here!\" because that's not a waypoint. So we move on to the next waypoint: \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" Does this contain all tokens from our input? Let me see: \"C&D\" is in the input, but \"coffee\" isn't there. Wait, actually, let's see. Our input after normalization is [\"it's\", \"too\", \"loud\", \"here!\"]. The waypoint name would be split into parts like \"cand\", which doesn't match any part of our normalized prompt.\n\nWait, maybe I need to process the entire input as a list and compare token by token with each waypoint. If one waypoint has all tokens present in order or with possible additional tokens (like prefixes) without missing important ones, it's considered a match.\n\nIn this case, \"C&D - Coffee Area\" might not cover \"it's\", \"too\", etc., so maybe it doesn't fit. Let me check other waypoints: Silent Study would include words like \"silent\" and \"study,\" but our prompt has more specific terms like \"loud\" which isn't in any waypoint.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the entire query isn't a waypoint name. Maybe the user wants to navigate through different points, each of which could be waypoints or other locations. But according to the rules, I have to pick known waypoints first. If none match, then maybe it's an invalid request or needs additional steps.\n\nWait, but the user didn't provide any waypoint names for \"it's\" and \"loud\". So perhaps they meant something else. Maybe the prompt was trying to navigate through certain locations, each of which can be reached via waypoints.\n\nSo in that case, I need to process all parts sequentially. Let me outline this step by step:\n\n1. Normalize both the user input and known waypoint names.\n2. Look for waypoint names that have tokens present in the normalized user input.\n3. If a waypoint matches, treat it as a path.\n4. If not, proceed with other functions or actions.\n\nSo for \"It's too loud here! Let's go to...\", the first part isn't a waypoint. The second part is going to Silent Study and then RoboHub.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the entire query into steps: navigate to the Coffee Area (C&D), then after receiving something, go to Silent Study, and afterwards check out RoboHub.\n\nBut how does that translate into actions? Maybe navigate to C&D Coffee Area, but I don't have a waypoint for \"C&D - Coffee Area\" because it doesn't match. So perhaps I'm missing something in the way the user is phrasing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant navigating through multiple waypoints or specific locations. Perhaps the prompt is trying to list different places and their order of visiting, each being a waypoint. But since none are fully matching, I might have to handle that by suggesting additional actions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example responses, in cases where there's ambiguity, it just says \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So if a single waypoint doesn't match, we return that and maybe other functions like wait or speak as needed. But in this case, since none of the waypoints match the entire normalized input, perhaps I should still attempt to navigate through them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is looking for directions step by step, each step being a waypoint. So they might want me to list all waypoints and then guide the user accordingly. But since there are no waypoints that fully match the structure of \"It's too loud here!\" as part of their query, I might need to parse it into steps or actions.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to handle this is to first look for any waypoint names in the normalized input. If none match, then maybe suggest moving to another place, but since all are waypoints, that can't be. So I'm stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to navigate through each waypoint's location step by step, which would require visiting each place. But without knowing which ones they are referring to, it's hard to proceed. Maybe the best approach is to process as many waypoints as possible and see if any match the structure of the query, then handle any remaining parts with other actions or functions.\n\nSo in this case, since none of the waypoint names fully match the normalized input, I might need to suggest that the user provides a complete list of waypoints or clarify their request. But I have to follow the rules strictly, so perhaps after identifying no matching waypoints, the system should trigger an action like \"I can help you find your way through all available waypoints,\" but in this case, since all are waypoints, maybe it's better to process each step as a waypoint.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it again:\n\n1. User input: It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\n\n2. Normalize everything to lowercase: \"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\"\n\n3. Split into tokens for both parts:\n   - User part: [\"it's\", \"too\", \"loud\", \"here!\"]\n   - Goal part: [\"let's\", \"go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"Silent\", \"Study,\", \"and\", \"then\", \"afterwards\", \",\", \"we\", \"can\", \"check out\", \"the\", \"RoboHub!\"]\n\n4. Look for waypoint names that have tokens present in the normalized input or possible additional prefixes.\n\n5. Check each known waypoint name:\n   - C&D - Coffee Area: contains \"coffee\" but not \"loud\". Not a match.\n   - Silent Study: contains \"silent\", which is part of \"silent\" in the user's message, but not sure if it's exact.\n   - RoboHub: has \"rob\" and \"hub\", but not directly relevant.\n\n6. Since none of the known waypoint names fully match the normalized input, I need to see if any of them cover parts of the query or suggest additional actions.\n\n7. Maybe treat each part as a step towards a destination:\n   - Go to C&D Coffee Area (even though there's no waypoint named that)\n   - Then go to Silent Study\n   - Afterward, check out RoboHub\n\nBut without knowing which waypoints correspond to where in the message, it's challenging.\n\n8. Perhaps I need to trigger an action like \"I can help you find your way through all available waypoints,\" but since all are waypoints, maybe just suggest visiting each as a step.\n\nAlternatively, if none of the waypoints match, perhaps return that the query does not have any known waypoint names matching the normalized input and suggest adding more details or clarifying.\n\nBut according to the user's prompt, they're asking for steps to navigate through certain points. So perhaps treating each part as a separate waypoint:\n\n- First go to C&D Coffee Area\n- Then Silent Study\n- Afterwards check out RoboHub\n\nBut without a waypoint for \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" it might be unclear.\n\nMaybe I should process all known waypoints first, then handle the remaining parts with other actions. But since none match, perhaps the system would suggest that and let the user know they need to provide more specific information or clarify their request.\n</think>\n\nI can help you navigate through various waypoints.
