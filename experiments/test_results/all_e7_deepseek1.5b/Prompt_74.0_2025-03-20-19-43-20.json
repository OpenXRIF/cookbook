For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I just received a new prompt from the user. Let me try to figure out how to handle this.\n\nFirst, looking at the example responses, it seems like when the user asks about a place or an action, I need to map that location to specific coordinates and input them into the speak command. Each coordinate should be within 1 unit of the target point to make sure it's accurately located.\n\nIn this new prompt, the user wants to go through several waypoints in order: North Entrance, C&D - Main Entrance, Microwaves area, Silent Study, shower A and B, and finally South Entrance. I need to map each of these places to their respective coordinates.\n\nI remember from earlier prompts that I have a list of waypoints with their names, coordinates, and functions. Each entry is pretty detailed, so I can find the exact location for each step in the user's instructions. \n\nWait, but some locations might not be directly accessible because they require passing through other areas or considering obstructions. But the example shows that they're mapped to specific points, even if the user didn't explicitly ask for obstructions or movements. It looks like I have to assume the user is just looking for coordinates and can move freely between steps unless told otherwise.\n\nSo, after identifying each waypoint's location, I'll structure the speak command with each coordinate in sequence. The actions will be \"navigate\" since they're moving from one point to another without obstacles mentioned. \n\nI need to make sure that each coordinate is within 1 unit of its target to avoid any issues. Even if some steps have exceptions, I think mapping them as coordinates should still work because the user can navigate around obstructions.\n\nAlright, let me break it down step by step and map each location correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe user's instruction seems to be requesting a series of movements and checkpoints in specific waypoints. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. Navigate from North Entrance to C&D - Main Entrance\n2. Visit Microwaves area (check for obstructions)\n3. Visit Silent Study, ensuring all units are operational\n4. Navigate to Shower A and shower B, inspecting cleanliness\n5. Finally, navigate to South Entrance\n\nEach location should be mapped accurately within the provided waypoint list, assuming the user can move freely between steps.\n\nThe action would be \"navigate\" as each movement is planned, but specific coordinates for each place are essential for accurate navigation.",
