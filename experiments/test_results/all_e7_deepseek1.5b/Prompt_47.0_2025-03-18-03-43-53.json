    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" First, I'll break down what they're asking for. They want me to navigate through two waypoints: the E5 Entrance and then the Microwave Zone. \n\nFrom the provided examples, it looks like each action is handled separately. The user specified a left-to-right sequence of commands. So, I should process the first part of the request before moving on to the next.\n\nThe available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. Since both waypoints require navigation, I'll need to handle two navigate actions. That means in the response, I should have two actions where each action is a separate entry in the \"actions\" array.\n\nLooking at the user's example, when they asked for specific keys, they received a navigate action with the key's location. So, for finding the Microwave Zone, I'll need to define its coordinates and input them into a speak action as well.\n\nI should make sure that both waypoints are properly addressed in order, without any additional commands or actions interfering. Also, since there's no ambiguity here, it shouldn't require further processing beyond what was given.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 20\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Microwave Zone\",\n        \"x\": 75,\n        \"y\": 65\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
