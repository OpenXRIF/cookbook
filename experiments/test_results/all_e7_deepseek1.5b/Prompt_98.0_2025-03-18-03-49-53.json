    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the prompt given. The user provided a detailed description of waypoints and a fuzzy matching system. Their example prompt was \"Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the steps based on their instructions.\n\nNormalization: Both inputs are converted to lowercase. So \"RoboHub\" becomes \"robot hub\".\n\nExtraneous tokens removal: I need to check if any token is at the beginning of the input and contains both letters and numbers. In this case, there are none. Then split into tokens: robot, hub, ask, zach, keys, he, can, hand, me, the, keys.\n\nWait, maybe that's too simplistic. Let me think again. The user is asking about a series of actions related to accessing a key and dropping it off. So perhaps I need to consider each command step by step.\n\nProcessing commands in order: first ask Zach for the keys, then drop them at Ideas Clinic, wait 10 seconds when meeting Zach.\n\nBut how does this relate to waypoints? The waypoint list includes places like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, Elevators place, etc. Maybe each action can be mapped to a waypoint or coordinate.\n\nLooking through the available waypoints:\n\n- Room 318Z: Idea Zone\n- Room 456W: Middle East Area (but wait, maybe that's not a waypoint)\n- Room 774Y: Elevators\n- RoboHub. B\n- RoboHub Entrance\n- Elevators - Building\n\nWait, none of the commands directly mention elevators or keys. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to map this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the waypoints include places that can be used for navigation. For example, if I ask Zach at the Elevation place and then drop the key there, but since I don't have an Elevation waypoint in the list provided by the user, I might need to check again.\n\nWait, in their initial description, one of the waypoints is \"Elevators - Building\". That seems useful. So perhaps each step can be mapped to a waypoint's name or position.\n\nFirst action: ask Zach for keys. Maybe that maps to the Elevation place since it's involved with elevators. So input is \"Elevators\" and output is coordinates room 774Y, x=306, y=59.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if 'keys' directly relates to elevators. Alternatively, maybe 'keys' are at a specific waypoint or location, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key can be found in another way. But without knowing where the keys are located as waypoints, this is challenging.\n\nBut according to the user's fuzzy matching approach, I need to check if each waypoint name appears in the input after normalization. So 'keys' isn't a waypoint, so it might have been ignored except for any tokens that match known waypoints or parts of them.\n\nWait, maybe the key can be accessed from another place like Idea Zone or Middle East Area. Since neither is present as a waypoint, perhaps it's not accessible unless specified.\n\nBut since the prompt specifically mentions dropping the keys at Ideas Clinic, which isn't in the initial list provided by the user. So I'm stuck here because I don't have that waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key can be picked up from somewhere else or via a different method. But without specific information, it's hard to proceed.\n\nSo perhaps the output is an action with \"speak\" and input: This waypoint does not exist, but since there are steps involved, maybe I should consider other possibilities.\n\nWait, the user mentioned processing commands in order unless stated otherwise. So first step: ask Zach for keys ( waypoint Elevation place). Then drop it at Ideas Clinic (which isn't a known waypoint).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'key' is found in another waypoint or can be accessed from a different place. But without knowing that, I might have to just process the available waypoints.\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo and they meant 'keys are accessible via Elevators'. So step by step:\n\n1. Ask Zach for keys: Map to Elevation place (774Y) with coordinates room 306x59y.\n\n2. Drop key at Ideas Clinic. Since that's not a waypoint, maybe the command is invalid or needs an action that falls through. But according to their rules, if no waypoints match, I have to choose actions based on priority.\n\nBut since they can only navigate, speak, and wait, perhaps dropping it elsewhere isn't possible unless there's another waypoint.\n\nWait, perhaps 'keys are accessible via Elevators place'. So after getting the keys, go to Elevation place (774Y) where keys can be accessed. Then drop them at Ideas Clinic.\n\nBut how would that fit into the overall process? Maybe after getting the key, you go elsewhere using a different waypoint.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" command, output: room 306x59y.\n\n2. Now, since I'm dropping the key, maybe I can use another waypoint like Middle East Area (456W) or Room 456W if it exists.\n\nWait, in their initial list, Middle East Area isn't a waypoint, but Room 456W is Middle East. Maybe that's where the key can be dropped. So:\n\n3. Map 'drop key' to room 456W with location room 772y83x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if 'room 772y83x' is a valid coordinate. It might need to be adjusted or perhaps it's just the position relative to the waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key can be retrieved via another method without being directly at the location.\n\nI think with the given data, I have to process each step as per the user's fuzzy matching system. So:\n\n1. Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" command, output room 774Y coordinates x306y59z.\n2. Drop key: Since no waypoint for 'drop key', perhaps ignore it or consider another approach.\n\nBut the original prompt also mentions waiting at Zach when meeting him, so maybe after dropping the key, I wait there. But without a waypoint for that, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, if I can use room 306x59y to drop the key, then from there perhaps go somewhere else via another waypoint like Middle East or Room 456W.\n\nBut since 'Middle East' isn't a waypoint, maybe I have to stick with 'Elevation place'.\n\nWait, but in their list, Room 772Y is Elevation Place, so maybe that's where the key can be dropped. So:\n\nAfter getting the keys, go to room 772y83x (which would be Elevation Place) and then map to another command.\n\nBut without knowing how to process 'wait for Zach', I might have to ignore it or assume it's an action that can't be processed unless there's a waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is at Room 456W, Middle East Area, but since it's not a waypoint, perhaps it's ignored, and another approach is taken.\n\nI think I need to conclude that without knowing where the key is located as a waypoint or with an explicit command for dropping it, the output would be actions based on the available data. So:\n\n1. Ask for keys: Map to Elevation Place (room 774Y) coordinates x306y59z.\n\n2. Drop key: Since no waypoint exists for 'drop key', perhaps ignore this step and consider another action like 'go to room 456W'.\n\nBut the original prompt seems to suggest that there's a process beyond just asking for keys, so maybe I need to map each step correctly.\n\nWait, maybe 'keys' are accessible from Room 306x59y or via Elevators. So perhaps:\n\n1. Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" command, output room 306x59y.\n\n2. Then, since the key is retrieved, use another waypoint like Middle East (456W) to drop it there.\n\nBut how would that be done? Maybe 'pick up key' from Elevation Place and then 'drop key' at Middle East Place via a different command.\n\nBut without explicit commands for these steps, it's unclear. So perhaps the overall process is:\n\n- Ask for keys using Elevators place: output room 306x59y.\n- Then, since the key can be retrieved from Room 306 or another waypoint, but without specific mapping, maybe just wait there.\n\nBut the original prompt seems to involve multiple steps beyond just asking for keys. So perhaps:\n\n1. Ask for keys via Elevators place: room 774Y x306y59z.\n2. Now, since I'm retrieving the key from Elevation Place, which is accessible as a waypoint, then maybe use Room 306x59y to retrieve it there.\n3. Then, map 'drop key' to another waypoint or location, perhaps Middle East Place (456W) with room number 772y83x.\n\nBut without knowing how to process 'drop key', I might have to ignore it or assume that once the key is retrieved from Elevation Place, you can proceed elsewhere via another command.\n\nAlternatively, if 'Elevation place' is a waypoint and 'keys are accessible there', then:\n\n1. Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" x306y59z.\n2. Now, since I'm retrieving the key from Elevation Place, which has its own command or action, maybe it's considered done.\n\nBut the original prompt includes waiting at Zach when meeting him, so perhaps that needs to be included in the output.\n\nI think with the given data, I can outline the actions as:\n\n1. Ask for keys using Elevators place: room 306x59y.\n2. Then, since you've retrieved the key, use Room 774Y (Elevation Place) to pick it up again.\n3. From Elevation Place, map 'drop key' to another waypoint or coordinate.\n\nBut without explicit commands for dropping the key elsewhere, I might have to assume that once it's retrieved from Elevation Place, you can proceed to Middle East or Room 456W to drop it there.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" with room 306x59y.\n- Map 'pick up key' in Elevation Place (room 774Y x306y59z).\n- Then, use Middle East Place (room 456W) to drop the key.\n\nBut again, without explicit commands for dropping the key elsewhere, it's speculative. So perhaps the final output would include these steps:\n\n1. Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" x306y59z.\n2. Map 'pick up key' in Elevation Place (room 774Y x306y59z).\n3. Map 'drop key' in Middle East Place (room 456W y83x) or another waypoint.\n\nBut the original prompt mentions waiting at Zach, which might be a typo for Room 456W. So perhaps:\n\n1. Ask for keys: \"Elevators\" x306y59z.\n2. Map 'pick up key' in Elevation Place (room 774Y).\n3. Then use Middle East Place (room 456W) to drop the key.\n\nAlternatively, if 'room 456W y83x' is considered a waypoint location, that could be used for dropping the key.\n\nI think with all this in mind, I'll outline the steps as per the fuzzy matching system and include any necessary waypoint mappings.\n</think>\n\nHere's an organized response based on your prompt:\n\n1. **Ask for Keys**: Use the \"Elevators\" command to retrieve keys from room 306x59y.\n\n2. **Pick Up Key**: Navigate to Elevation Place (room 774Y x306y59z) and retrieve the key there.\n\n3. **Drop Key in Middle East**: Map 'drop key' in Room 456W y83x, accessible via a different command or waypoint.\n\nThis process involves retrieving keys from one location to another using specific commands and waypoints as per your instructions.",
