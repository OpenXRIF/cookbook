For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this query. The user has given me a detailed prompt about handling various edge cases and specific commands. They want me to create an action list based on their input.\n\nFirst, looking at the example they provided: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" The output is an action with \"navigate\" twice. I think that's because each part of the query needs a separate navigate action. \n\nLet me break it down. \"Travel to the E5 Entrance\" would be one command, so I need to send two actions: navigate from E5 Entrance to where? Hmm, wait, maybe just one action for going there and then another for finding Microwaves.\n\nBut wait, Microwaves is a waypoint name. So after navigating to E5, the user wants to find it. Since it's not in an area named like \"C&D - ...\", I should probably send a speak command at the position of Microwaves. \n\nSo the actions would be: navigate from RoboHub Entrance (or maybe just start there) and then navigate back to Microwaves? Or is it different?\n\nActually, no. The user needs to go to E5 first, which is an entrance, not a room or area yet. So perhaps navigating to E5's entrance. Then, after that, find the Microwaves in their location.\n\nWait, but Microwaves is also called \"Microfries\" in Spanish, so maybe I should send speak commands for each action separately.\n\nSo first, navigate from RoboHub Entrance to E5 Entrance. Second, when at E5 Entrance, look for Microwaves and move there. But how? Maybe just two actions: navigate twice for the two positions.\n\nAlternatively, since it's moving around, maybe both in one command or separate commands.\n\nI'm a bit confused about whether it's two separate actions or if I can do it in one with a loop.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, when they have multiple places to move, each is handled separately. So probably, I should handle each part as individual actions.\n\nSo, first action: navigate from RoboHub Entrance to E5 Entrance. Second action: when there, look for Microwaves and navigate to it. Or maybe just navigate back if it's a room.\n\nWait, but Microwaves is a waypoint name, so perhaps the user wants to find it, not go back. So maybe only one action after navigating to E5.\n\nSo the actions would be: navigate from RoboHub to E5, then when at E5, look for Microwaves and move there. Or just two separate actions.\n\nI think since both are waypoints, I should send two actions: first to E5 Entrance, second to Microwaves. But maybe they can be done in one command with a loop or something, but according to the rules, each known waypoint is handled separately unless it's implied by additional tokens.\n\nGiven that, I'll have two speak commands: one for navigating to E5 and another for locating Microwaves.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the microwaves here?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Microwave Room - Room 247\",\n                \"x\": 10,\n                \"y\": 5\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
