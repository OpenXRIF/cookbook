    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I just received this query where the user said, \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\" Hmm, I need to figure out how to respond. Let me think about what's required here.\n\nFirst, looking at the available functions, the user can choose navigate, speak, or wait. So my first thought is that this request is ambiguous because it mentions two locations: an unknown zone and the RoboHub. But since I don't have any waypoint data for the unknown zone, maybe I should consider what's possible.\n\nThe user wants to go through both zones. Without a way to navigate back or confirm where the unknown zone is, my initial thought is that I can't assist with it directly. So perhaps I should inform them about the issue and offer to help with something else if they provide more details.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Maybe the user wants to move through each waypoint in order: first go to the unknown zone and then RoboHub. If I don't know where the unknown zone is, I can't give specific instructions. So again, it seems like an incomplete request.\n\nAlso, considering the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, I should respond by asking for more information or clarification. That way, the user knows their query isn't valid and can proceed with additional details if needed.\n\nSo putting it all together, my response should acknowledge the request but clarify that without knowing where \"unknown zone\" is, I can't help further. Then offer assistance in another way to make them feel supported.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
