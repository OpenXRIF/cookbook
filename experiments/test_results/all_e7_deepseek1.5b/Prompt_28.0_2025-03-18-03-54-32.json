    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user sent this prompt: \"Honestly, I don't like coffee. go to the robohub\". Let me try to figure out what they need.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples, it seems like they're asking for directions or specific locations. In the example where someone said, \"go to the C and D areas\", the response was a navigation command pointing to those spots. So when the user says \"go to the robohub\", I should probably respond similarly.\n\nBut wait, are these waypoints available? Let me check the provided data. There are entries for C&D Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, and Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic. The other keywords in the prompt aren't exactly words from the waypoint list. So maybe it's about a new or unknown area.\n\nHmm, I think I should first process the query to see if it relates to any known waypoints. The user isn't asking for a specific location but rather for direction. Since there are no waypoint names matching \"go\" or \"to robohub\", perhaps that's not applicable here. Or maybe it's an ambiguous command.\n\nAlso, considering the edge cases: if something isn't a valid waypoint, return a speak action saying it doesn't exist. But this prompt is more about direction than locating a specific area. So I'm leaning towards just providing a speak action since there's no match in the known waypoints.\n\nWait, but maybe the user wants to go through certain areas before reaching robohub. Let me check if any waypoint names include \"go\" or suggest path instructions. Scanning through the list: none of the waypoints seem to directly indicate going through other locations except RoboHub Entrance and Ideas Clinic. But that's too vague for a specific direction.\n\nI think it's safer to follow the instructions given in the prompt. Since there are no known waypoints matching \"go\" or \"robohub\", I'll respond with an action that indicates it doesn't exist, even though maybe the user was trying to get directions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
