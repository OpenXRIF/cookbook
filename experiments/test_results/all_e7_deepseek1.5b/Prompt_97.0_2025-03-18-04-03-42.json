    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the given prompt. The user provided a new query where they want the robot to move to an unknown waypoint called \"[[Assembly Room]]\" with specific conditions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples, when the robot has an invalid or ambiguous command, it returns a speak action with an error message. So, I should check if \"[[Assembly Room]]\" is a known waypoint. From the information given earlier, there's no waypoint named exactly like that. It could be part of a building code or another identifier.\n\nSince it's not present in the known list, the system can't find any matches for this command. According to the rules, if no waypoint is found, it should output an action where the \"action\" is \"speak\" and the input says the waypoint doesn't exist. That seems straightforward.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following all the guidelines provided. The normalization step converts both inputs and waypoints to lowercase. But since there's nothing in the query about case, it shouldn't affect this particular example.\n\nAdditionally, the command includes complex instructions: moving to an unknown area, waiting for confirmation, etc. However, these are handled by not finding any known waypoint, so the fallback applies.\n\nI think that's all. Just return the error message as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: '[[Assembly Room]]' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
