    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the robot should respond when given the prompt \"Robot, go to North Entrance and wait for 15 minutes.\" Let me break down the steps based on the provided understanding of user prompts.\n\nFirst, looking at the normalization step. Both the input and each waypoint name are converted to lowercase. So, \"North Entrance\" becomes \"north entrance,\" and the existing waypoints list also has entries in lowercase as well. I should check if any of the known waypoint names match this normalized input.\n\nNext, extracting extraneous tokens. I need to remove any tokens that don't seem essential. For example, if a token contains both letters and digits at the beginning, it's probably not an identifier and can be discarded. In this case, \"North Entrance\" doesn't have such issues, so no changes here.\n\nTokenization is next. Both the normalized input and each waypoint are split into individual words. The normalized input is just [\"north\", \"entrance\"], while looking through the known waypoints, I find a waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" Wait, that's not matching \"north entrance,\" so maybe there isn't an exact match here.\n\nNow, similarity calculation. Since none of the known waypoints match \"north entrance\" exactly, we check each waypoint to see if all its tokens are present in the normalized input. The only word is \"microwaves,\" which doesn't match \"north.\" Therefore, no waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold.\n\nHandling complex commands: According to the supported edge cases, if a function beyond \"navigate,\" \"speak,\" or \"wait\" is requested and no known waypoint exists that fulfills the command, we return an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and the input as \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nPutting it all together, since there's no matching waypoint for \"north entrance,\" the robot should respond by saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\" It doesn't need to perform any navigation or speak; the action is simply to acknowledge that the request isn't valid.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
