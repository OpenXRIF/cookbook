    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down how I approached answering the user's query. The user provided a specific prompt about navigating to an unknown waypoint and then going to the RoboHub.\n\nFirst, I considered the existing system knowledge. Looking at the available waypoints, there was no one with \"E7 silent study.\" So, my first thought was that this wasn't a recognized waypoint, which would trigger the fallback action of speaking.\n\nI realized that the prompt included both navigation and an unknown command. According to the handling guidelines, I should process commands in order unless stated otherwise. Since \"take me to\" is straightforward and didn't mention any obstacles or ambiguities, it was executed first.\n\nThen, since it wasn't a recognized waypoint, my system selected the speak action with the input as \"invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint.\" This meets the edge case where an unknown waypoint exists, so I knew to return that specific message.\n\nI also made sure to follow the structure of previous examples, ensuring consistency in how actions were triggered and inputs were formatted. By doing this, I maintained consistency in how the system responds to various prompts.\n\nOverall, my approach was methodical: check for known waypoints first, then handle unknown commands with a fallback mechanism if necessary.\n</think>\n\nHere's how I would process your request:\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Normalization:** \n   - Convert both \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" and each waypoint name in the available list (e.g., \"E7 silent study\") to lowercase. The normalized versions are:\n     - User input: `take me to e7 silent study`\n     - waypoint names: `e7 silent study`, etc.\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:**\n   - Remove tokens that likely represent building codes or non-essential identifiers.\n   - In this case, \"Take\" is a prefix and can be removed as it's not an essential identifier in the context of navigation commands.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n   - Split both normalized strings into individual words:\n     - User input: `take me to e7 silent study`\n     - waypoint names: `e7 silent study`, etc.\n   - The normalized user input becomes `[ \"take\", \"me\", \"to\", \"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\" ]`.\n   - Any known waypoint name is split into its individual tokens, such as the waypoint name.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n   - For each known waypoint (e.g., \"E7 silent study\"), assess the match by checking if every token from the normalized user input appears in the waypoint name.\n     - Since there are no known waypoints matching the normalized user input, none of them will meet or exceed the similarity threshold.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n   - Since no known waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, the system outputs an action to speak with the input indicating that the waypoint does not exist.\n   - This triggers a fall-through to the default \"speak\" action.\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - The system will output:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"actions\": [\n         {\n           \"action\": \"speak\",\n           \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\nThis approach ensures consistency with the provided guidelines and handles unknown waypoints appropriately.",
