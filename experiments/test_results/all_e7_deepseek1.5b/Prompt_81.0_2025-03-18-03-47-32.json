    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this specific user prompt. The user wants me to go to the C&D and ask for a coffee, then go to the Design Team Bay. Let's break down each part of their request.\n\nFirst, understanding the available waypoints: there are several, like C&D Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, Room 1427 Ideas Clinic, etc. I remember from earlier prompts that some waypoint names have special characters in them, but they might be part of a larger name, not standalone words. So I need to check if the tokens match the waypoint names.\n\nThe user's prompt involves going to two different places: C&D and then Design Team Bay. Let me list out all possible waypoints that could fit:\n\n1. C&D Coffee Area\n2. C&D - Coffee Area (already in point 1)\n3. C&D Zone (but I don't have this waypoint name)\n4. RoboHub Entrance (appears twice, but same meaning)\n5. Design Team Bay is a waypoint, let's call it DTB.\n\nSo the user is asking to go to two different locations: first to the Coffee Area within the C&D zone, then to DTB after that.\n\nI need to think about how the navigation function works. It might require going through waypoints, possibly using an OR path if multiple waypoints are needed. So the steps could be:\n\n1. Navigate to C&D Zone.\n2. Ask for a coffee at C&D Coffee Area.\n3. Navigating from there to DTB.\n\nBut I have to check if each waypoint is present in the list of known ones. The user might have spelled \"Coffee Area\" as two words, so that needs to be matched against the known waypoint names.\n\nI should also ensure that any additional tokens before or after these waypoints don't prevent a match. For example, if the input was just \"C&D Coffee Area\" without any extra tokens, that's fine. But if there were tokens like \"coffee\" at the beginning, it would be skipped.\n\nSo, in this case, I need to have the navigation function check both forms of C&D and DTB. If either is present, the user should be able to navigate through them.\n\nI think the output actions should include navigating twice: once for C&D Zone and then from there to DTB. Also, the speak action would ask for the coffee and wait before going to DTB.\n\nWait, but the user's prompt doesn't specify asking for a coffee first; it's just going to the two places. So maybe I need to include both actions: searching for the coffee area and then navigating to DTB after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is more about specifying all waypoints in sequence without asking for each step separately. But looking at the example prompts, they sometimes ask for specific commands like \"speak\" followed by a question or instruction.\n\nI think I should include both the navigation steps and any necessary speak actions based on the waypoints. So first navigate to C&D Zone, then from there, navigate again towards DTB after fetching the coffee.\n\nWait, but if the user is just asking for going through two different places, maybe they need to ask for a coffee in one place before going elsewhere. So perhaps the input should include both requests: go to C&D Zone and then fetch coffee, then navigate to DTB.\n\nBut looking back at the prompt, it's \"Go to the C&D and ask for a coffee then go to the Design Team Bay.\" That seems like two separate steps without any commands except for asking for the coffee. So maybe I should structure the input as:\n\n1. Navigate to C&D Zone.\n2. Ask for a coffee in that area (if it's a waypoint, which it is).\n3. Navigating from there to DTB.\n\nBut how do I include the speak action for the coffee? Maybe after navigating to the C&D and getting the coffee, then navigate again to DTB without asking anything else.\n\nWait, but if the user only wants to go through both places, perhaps they don't need to ask for the coffee. So maybe just go directly from C&D Zone to DTB after fetching the coffee is sufficient? But I'm not sure; perhaps the initial prompt implies that the coffee needs to be obtained before proceeding.\n\nI think I should include both steps: navigating to C&D Zone, then fetching the coffee (if it's a waypoint), and then going to DTB. So in terms of input tokens:\n\n- Navigating to \"C&D - Coffee Area\"\n- Then navigate from there to \"Design Team Bay\"\n\nBut perhaps just specifying all waypoints directly would be better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to go to both places without fetching the coffee first. But that seems less likely based on the prompt.\n\nSo, I'll structure the input as:\n\nNavigate to C&D Zone\nAsk for a coffee in there (which is a waypoint)\nThen navigate from there to Design Team Bay\n\nBut I need to make sure each of these waypoints exists in our known list and that the tokens match correctly.\n\nI should also check if any additional navigation steps are needed, like using an OR path or multiple paths. Since we're using a single navigation point, maybe two separate navigations from C&D Zone.\n\nWait, but how do I represent going from one point to another? Maybe by appending after navigating back to C&D Zone.\n\nSo the input would be:\n\n1. Navigating to C&D Zone.\n2. From there, navigate again towards Design Team Bay.\n\nBut without knowing the exact syntax for combining these, it's a bit tricky. Perhaps I can include both waypoints in one query if they're present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just needs to specify all the necessary steps as separate input tokens, each representing a navigation step.\n\nIn any case, I think the output should include two navigate actions: one to C&D Zone and another from there to DTB. The speak action would ask for the coffee in C&D Zone, and then the second speak action would ask for nothing (since it's the last step).\n\nWait, but if the user just wants to go through both places without fetching anything else, maybe after getting the coffee, they don't need to do anything else. But I'm not sure.\n\nI think I'll proceed by including all necessary navigation steps and speak actions as required.\n</think>\n\nThe output should guide the user through navigating to C&D Zone and then from there to Design Team Bay while asking for the coffee in the first step.\n\n**Input:**\n Navigate to \"C&D - Coffee Area\"\n Ask for a coffee\n Navigate from there to \"Design Team Bay\"\n\nThis ensures that the user is navigated through both waypoints, with the necessary speak action for fetching the coffee.",
