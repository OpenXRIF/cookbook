    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me go through the steps outlined in the guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll start by normalizing both the user's input and each waypoint name. That means converting everything to lowercase. So \"E7 silent study\" becomes \"e7 silent study,\" and each waypoint's name is already given in lowercase, like \"E7 - silent study.\"\n\nNext, I need to remove any extraneous tokens from both inputs. Looking at the user's prompt, there are no obvious extraneous tokens since it's straightforward. Each waypoint name has individual words that don't seem redundant.\n\nThen, I'll split both the normalized input and each known waypoint into individual tokens. The normalized user input is a list: [\"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\"]. For each waypoint, like \"E7 - silent study,\" I'll get separate tokens for each part.\n\nFor similarity calculation, I need to check if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input. In this case, the waypoint names are just one entry: \"e7\", \"silent\", \"study.\" So I only have three tokens to match against.\n\nNow, comparing each token:\n\n- \"e7\": The normalized prompt doesn't have \"e7,\" so that might be a problem.\n- \" silent\": There's no word like \" silent\" in the prompt.\n- \" study\": Again, there's nothing like this.\n\nSince none of the tokens from the waypoint match exactly, I need to see if any part of the input is similar. The normalized prompt doesn't mention anything related to E7. So perhaps it's not a matching waypoint name at all.\n\nLooking back at the supported edge cases, if no known waypoint matches, the system should respond with an action like \"speak\" and include an error message saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nI also need to consider handling complex commands but this example is straightforward. The user is asking for a specific room, which doesn't involve any steps or multiple interpretations beyond matching the input.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the system will check if there's a waypoint named E7 with related terms like \"silent study.\" Since there isn't such a waypoint in the provided list, it will return an action to speak and mention that the waypoint does not exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user is asking for \"Take me to the E7 silent study,\" which doesn't match any known waypoints. The system should respond with:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7 - silent study' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
