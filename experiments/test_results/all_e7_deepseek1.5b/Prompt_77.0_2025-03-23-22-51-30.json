For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Robot, start at C&D - Snack Area and inspect for spills or trash.

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's prompt about their robot. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user has given a detailed list of waypoints they want the robot to follow. The prompt starts with \"Robot,\" which probably means the bot is handling physical tasks, not just speaking or navigating. So I should focus on commands and actions related to moving around different areas and interacting with things inside those areas.\n\nThe first part says: \"start at C&D - Snack Area and inspect for spills or trash.\" I see that \"Snack Area\" isn't in the list of known waypoints we have. The available ones are like C&D - Coffee, RoboHub Entrance, etc. So this might be a problem because it's unclear which area is called Snack.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the examples, sometimes the user specifies things like C&D - Snack Area, but in reality, that doesn't match any known waypoint. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the user meant something else or perhaps there are additional waypoints defined here?\n\nNext, after inspecting, it says: \"Then proceed to C&D - Cold Drink Area and ensure all drinks are properly stocked.\" That's a clear command but again, if C&D - Cold Drink isn't in our known list, maybe that's an issue. But wait, the known waypoint names go up to C&D - Hot Food Area. So perhaps \"Cold Drink\" is actually part of another area or there's confusion.\n\nMoving on: \"Next, move to the C&D - Pastry Area and check for expired products.\" Again, if Pastry isn't in our list, this might be an error. But looking at the available waypoints, I don't see a Pastry section. Maybe it's part of another area or there are additional ones here that aren't mentioned.\n\nAfter handling those areas, it says: \"Finally, go to the C&D - Coffee Area to confirm cleanliness.\" Then it suggests returning to the base station. But again, if C&D - Coffee isn't in our list, this could be a problem. Wait, I see that in the initial normalization steps, we have \"C&D - Coffee\" as one of the waypoint names. So maybe \"Coffee Area\" is the same as \"C&D - Coffee Area.\"\n\nBut wait, let me check: The user wrote \"C&D - Snack Area\" and so on, but in their prompt, it's written as \"Robot, start at C&D - Snack Area...\" Maybe they meant something else. Or perhaps the waypoint names are in lowercase? Wait, no, the normalization step says to convert both to lowercase. But in the known waypoints list, I don't see any with lowercase letters.\n\nWait, looking again: The user provided a list of available waypoints, including \"C&D - Coffee\" and others. So if the user writes C&D - Snack Area, that might not match any waypoint. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe they have additional waypoints defined here beyond what's shown in the initial prompt.\n\nBut based on the given known waypoints, I can't find anything for Snack or Pastry Areas. That could be a problem because the user is trying to instruct the robot to do specific tasks there. So maybe that's an error, but perhaps they meant something else or it's part of another area in this context.\n\nNext, after all those areas, it says: \"Finally, go to the C&D - Coffee Area to confirm cleanliness.\" But again, I need to check if C&D - Coffee is a known waypoint. Looking back at the available list, yes, there's a waypoint called C&D - Coffee. So that might be intended.\n\nBut then it suggests returning to the base station. Wait, where is the base station? From the initial prompt, it seems like the starting location is (0,0). But in the known waypoints, RoboHub Entrance is at (25, 50), which is further away. Maybe that's an error because the user wants to go back to the base after doing all those tasks.\n\nBut wait, let me list out what I know:\n\n- Known Waypoints:\n   - C&D - Coffee\n   - RoboHub Entrance\n   - RoboHub\n   - C&D - Cold Drink\n   - C&D - Hot Food\n   - C&D - Snack\n   - C&D - Pastry\n\nWait, no, in the available list given by the user's initial prompt, I only see up to \"C&D - Hot Food Area.\" So perhaps there are missing waypoint names like \"Snack,\" \"Pastry,\" and others. This could cause confusion because the user is trying to instruct the robot on specific areas.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user's instructions seem a bit off due to unknown waypoints or duplicated names. The key areas they want the robot to do are C&D - Coffee, C&D - Cold Drink, C&D - Hot Food, and C&D - Snack (or maybe C&D - Pastry). They also mention confirming cleanliness at C&D - Coffee and returning to a base station.\n\nBut since \"Snack\" isn't a waypoint, the user might have intended something else. Similarly, \"Pastry\" isn't present either, which could be another problem. This inconsistency makes it difficult for the robot to follow their instructions precisely because it doesn't know where those specific areas are.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the user's instructions seem incomplete or have typos, especially with the waypoint names missing. Without a clear path and without knowing where each area is, responding would be tricky. Maybe they need to clarify which waypoints are defined here or add more details about the areas.\n</think>\n\nBased on the detailed instructions provided by the user, the robot's task involves navigating through several areas while interacting within them. However, there are inconsistencies in the waypoint names and missing areas, making precise execution challenging. Here's a structured response:\n\n1. **Clarification Needed**: The user has mentioned specific areas but lacks clear waypoints or names for \"Snack,\" \"Pastry,\" and other missing areas. This could lead to confusion and partial task completion.\n\n2. **Known Waypoints**:\n   - C&D - Coffee\n   - RoboHub Entrance\n   - RoboHub (though not explicitly a waypoint, may be implied by the context)\n   - C&D - Cold Drink\n   - C&D - Hot Food\n\n3. **Execution Plan**:\n   - The user aims to confirm cleanliness at C&D - Coffee and ensure all drinks are properly stockilled.\n   - After handling each area, return to the base station.\n\n4. **Potential Issues**:\n   - Missing waypoints like Snack and Pastry require clarification or addition of definitions.\n   - Unclear navigation path due to unspecified areas might lead to partial task completion.\n\n5. **Response**:\n   - Acknowledge the need for additional waypoint information to ensure precise navigation.\n   - Instruct the robot to confirm cleanliness at C&D - Coffee, stock all drinks, and return to the base station as per the known areas.\n\nThis structured approach addresses the ambiguities and ensures clarity on how the robot should move through the specified areas.",
