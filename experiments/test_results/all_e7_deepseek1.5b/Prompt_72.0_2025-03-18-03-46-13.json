    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's query. The user said, \"I could really go for a shower.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound like a command with waypoints or functions. It's more of an ordinary sentence. So first, I should consider the supported actions.\n\nLooking at the documentation, there are three main functions: navigate, speak, and wait. But this query isn't about navigating anywhere specific, speaking to someone named Zach, or waiting for 10 seconds. It's just a general statement. \n\nI remember from the examples that if the command doesn't match any supported actions, it should return an action with \"speak\" but no input. So I need to make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nWait, maybe there's an edge case where something is ambiguous or outside the supported actions. Since this isn't a navigation request, a speak request, or a wait command, it definitely falls into the unsupported actions category.\n\nSo applying the rules, if any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, I should return an action that includes an error message. That means instead of just outputting a generic speak action with no input, I need to mention the unsupported function and maybe provide an example.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should be similar to one of those edge case examples where the user mentions something invalid, like \"unknown zone,\" but in this case, there's nothing similar. So instead, I'll tell them that it's an invalid request and explain what a valid request might look like.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'go for a shower' is not a valid action.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
