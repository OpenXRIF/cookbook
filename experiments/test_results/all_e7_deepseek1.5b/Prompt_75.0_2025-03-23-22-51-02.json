For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

After that, navigate to the Assembly Room to complete another drop-off. Lastly, return to C&D - Coffee Area and confirm the next order for transport.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this command prompt provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user has given a detailed set of waypoints with their locations. They also mentioned that waypoints can be matched based on similarity without needing every token present. So, my task is to parse the given command into its components and see which waypoints match each part.\n\nThe example prompt was about navigating from C&D - Coffee Area to RoboHub. That makes sense because it's a straightforward path with two points: one for picking up items and another for dropping them off. The actions here are navigate to coffee area, then navigate to RoboHub.\n\nNow, looking at the command given by the user:\n\n- Start at C&D - Hot Food Area\n- Collect a prepared order (which is likely an item)\n- Move to RoboHub and drop off the package\n- Then go to Ideas Clinic for another delivery\n- After that, navigate to the Assembly Room\n- Confirm the next order for transport.\n\nSo, each of these steps corresponds to specific waypoints. Let me map them out:\n\n1. **C&D - Hot Food Area**: This is a waypoint that contains food items and likely a prepared order. So this should be matched as a \"navigate\" action with the location provided.\n2. **RoboHub**: The user wants to drop off the package, which would require going there. So another navigate action here.\n3. **Ideas Clinic**: After delivering again, they need to go back to this one.\n4. **Assembly Room**: Finally, before confirming transport, they should go back to this room.\n\nPutting it all together, each step after the initial pickup is a separate navigate action: RoboHub, Ideas Clinic, and Assembly Room. After dropping off everything, confirm for transport without moving beyond that room.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following the advanced fuzzy matching rules. For example, if there are extra tokens like \"package\" or \"order\" at the start of the command, they're ignored unless it's an essential part of the waypoint name. But in this case, each step is a clear action without such extraneous parts.\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention anything about functions beyond navigate and speak directly. So if any of these actions are beyond those, I should return an error message saying \"Unsupported action requested.\" However, \"navigate\" seems to be necessary here because it's moving around locations, so that's acceptable.\n\nAnother thing is making sure each waypoint is correctly matched. For example, after picking up the package at C&D - Hot Food Area, they move to RoboHub to drop it off. Similarly for the other deliveries and confirmations.\n\nI should also ensure that if a waypoint doesn't match exactly, I fallback to speak with an error message, but in this case, all waypoints are clearly defined and fit the commands.\n\nSo, overall, each step from pickup to transport is handled by a navigate action, except maybe the confirm for transport at the last room. But since they don't need to move beyond that, it's fine.\n\nWait, the example given didn't include any speak actions because all were navigate. So I should stick with navigate actions unless specified otherwise.\n\nI think that covers everything. Each part of the command is a known waypoint or can be matched to one, and the actions are appropriately chosen.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\",\n        \"x\": 82,\n        \"y\": 61\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 30,\n        \"y\": 50\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 98,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Assembly Room\",\n        \"x\": 30, \n        \"y\": 80\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This is the final confirmation for transport.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
