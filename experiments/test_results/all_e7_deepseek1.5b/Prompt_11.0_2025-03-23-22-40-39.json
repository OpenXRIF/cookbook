For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I just saw this prompt: \"It's too loud here! Let's go to the Silent Study, and then afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out what actions to take based on the guidelines provided.\n\nFirst, let me break down the steps. The user wants me to navigate to two waypoints: \"Silent Study\" and then \"RoboHub\". But wait, before diving in, there's something about handling complex commands. So even though the command mentions checking out the RoboHub, maybe that's part of an action.\n\nLet me start by recalling the normalization rules. Both the user input and each waypoint name need to be converted to lowercase. That shouldn't be a problem here because everything is lowercase already. \n\nNext, extraneous token removal. I don't see any tokens at the beginning of the input that are building codes or non-essential, so that's good.\n\nTokenization: Splitting both the user's prompt and each waypoint into words. The user is talking about going to \"Silent Study\" first, then checking out RoboHub. So the waypoints would be \"Silent Study\" and \"RoboHub\".\n\nNow, similarity calculation. For each waypoint, I need to see if all its tokens are present in the input. The user's prompt includes \"go to\", so that might help with both waypoints.\n\nLooking at \"Silent Study\": It has two words, \"Silent\" and \"Study\". Does the input mention anything about these? Let me check: No specific instructions for Silent or study spots except it's a waypoint. So I don't think they're present in the input. That means neither \"Silent Study\" nor \"RoboHub\" meet the similarity threshold because their tokens aren't found.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the prompt. It says \"check out the RoboHub.\" Maybe that's part of an action? So perhaps it's not a waypoint but another command or action. I should treat that separately.\n\nSo the user is asking for two waypoints: Silent Study and RoboHub, along with checking out the RoboHub afterwards. But since RoboHub is already in the prompt, maybe that's redundant. Or perhaps \"check out\" is part of a separate action.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, when a waypoint isn't found, it returns an action to speak and input for that. So if all waypoints are missing, I should handle it similarly.\n\nBut here, the user specifically mentions checking out RoboHub in the prompt. Maybe it's part of another action. Alternatively, perhaps \"check out\" is just a way of saying go to the room, so maybe it's redundant and can be ignored for now.\n\nSo focusing on the two waypoints: Silent Study and RoboHub. Neither seems to be present in the input based on my tokenization, because neither has any specific building codes or other identifiers that appear in the prompt beyond general places like \"It's too loud here!\".\n\nTherefore, since both waypoints are missing, I should respond by asking for their locations using the normalized names. That means speaking and providing the normalized names of each waypoint.\n\nSo my actions would be to navigate to \"Silent Study\" first, then after that, navigate to \"RoboHub\". But wait, the prompt also says \" afterwards, we can check out the RoboHub.\" So maybe I should include that as an additional action?\n\nWait, in the examples given, commands are processed in a left-to-right sequence unless specified otherwise. So if the user gives multiple commands, they should be executed one after another.\n\nSo perhaps I need to handle \"check out\" as a separate action or integrate it into the navigation. But since the prompt says it's part of the way to check out RoboHub later, maybe that's not necessary for now and can be ignored unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut in the guidelines, handling complex commands allows processing multiple steps unless stated otherwise. However, if any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, I should output a speak action with an error message. But since navigating to these waypoints is clear, that shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nSo my plan is: navigate to \"Silent Study\" and then \"RoboHub\". Since neither are present in the input, I'll ask for their locations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Silent Study\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 200,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
