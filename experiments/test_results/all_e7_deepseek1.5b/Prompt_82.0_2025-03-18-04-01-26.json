    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's query. The user has given me a prompt asking for directions to go to the Dairy Queen, but in Chinese. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to translate \"Can you go to the Dairy Queen?\" into English. Translating that might not be necessary unless there are specific instructions about how to phrase the query. But since it's just a general request for directions, maybe translation isn't needed. Wait, actually, looking back at the initial prompt provided by the user, they seem to have translated their own queries. For example, when someone says \"Can you go to the Dairy Queen?\", they translate that into English before processing further.\n\nSo, in this case, I should respond with a translated version of the query: \"Go to Dairy Queen\". Then, I need to handle the waypoint matching and command execution as per the given guidelines.\n\nI recall from the previous examples that when handling unknown waypoints, the response is an action list with \"speak\" and the message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. So, if I find that the user's request translates to a waypoint that isn't recognized, I should return that same structure but translated for consistency.\n\nNext, let me outline the steps I need to follow based on the given guidelines:\n\n1. **Normalization:** Convert both the user's input and each known waypoint name to lowercase. This step is crucial because it standardizes the input, making comparison easier.\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:** Remove tokens that are at the beginning of the input or contain both letters and digits. These are likely building codes or non-essential identifiers, so removing them will give a cleaner input.\n\n3. **Tokenization:** Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words. This allows for a direct comparison between the query and the known waypoints.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:** Check if every token from the waypoint name is present in the normalized user input. Alternatively, ensure that a high percentage of tokens (like 80% or more) are present. If both conditions are met, it's considered a match. This step helps handle cases where extra tokens might be included without causing confusion.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:** If multiple waypoints meet the similarity threshold, select the one with the highest similarity score. If none meet the threshold, output an action saying \"speak\" and an error message that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nNow, applying these steps to the user's query: \"Can you go to the Dairy Queen?\" \n\nFirst, I'll translate it into English as \"Go to Dairy Queen\". Then, I need to consider if this is a known waypoint. Scanning through the provided waypoints, I don't see one that specifically refers to \"Dairy Queen\" or \"Dq\". So, there's no matching waypoint available.\n\nGiven that, the next step is to output an action with \"speak\" and instructing the user to go to Dairy Queen in the specified coordinates. This aligns with handling unknown waypoints as per the guidelines.\n\nI should make sure to normalize everything by converting both inputs (user query and known waypoints) to lowercase, remove extraneous tokens where necessary, tokenize them, then perform similarity checks. In this case, since there's no match, I don't need to select a waypoint but instead provide a speak action with the required input.\n\nI think that covers all the steps. Let me put it all together in the final response.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Go to Dairy Queen\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
