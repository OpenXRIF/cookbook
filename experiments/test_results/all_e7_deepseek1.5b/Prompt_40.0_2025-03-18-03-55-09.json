    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to respond when someone asks for help taking them to an unknown waypoint like \"E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the user's prompt, they want someone to take them to a specific location. But in their case, that location doesn't exist yet. I remember from earlier examples that if there's no known waypoint matching the request, the system should return an action with \"speak\" and say the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, applying that logic here. The user is requesting to go to E7 silent study, which isn't a waypoint listed. Since it's not in the known list, I need to output a speak command. The input will be \"This waypoint does not exist.\" That makes sense because there's no way to address the request without prompting for a valid waypoint first.\n\nI should make sure that the response is clear and follows the specified format. No extra fluff, just the necessary action and the input message explaining it doesn't work. That should cover all bases.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
