    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to translate this user prompt into a set of actions. The prompt says, \"Navigate to the Ideas clinic and then go to the assembly room.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part means. \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic\" is a direct command from the navigation menu. That's one action: navigate to the Ideas clinic. \n\nThen there's \"go to the Assembly Room,\" which is another step. Since that's another waypoint, I need to check if there's an entry for that. Looking back at the provided waypoints, under Microwaves I see a waypoint called \"Assembly Rooms\" with tokens like \"room\" and others. So that should be my second action.\n\nWait, but in the available functions, navigate is one of them. So just two actions: navigate to Ideas and then assemble.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Assembly Rooms\",\n                \"x\": 200,\n                \"y\": 80\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
