For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to process the user's prompt given the rules. Let me read through the example again. The user wants \"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the waypoint names. The words mentioned are \"Robot\" which is a function in the available list, then \"proceed\", but that's not a known waypoint. So, this seems like a complex command with multiple steps.\n\nFollowing the guidelines, commands should be processed left-to-right unless stated otherwise. The user provided a simple action, navigate, to move from \"Robot\" location to \"Silent Study\". Then wait for 10 minutes.\n\nI need to handle each part step by step. First, I'll translate \"proceed to Silent Study\" into the waypoint format. So, the input becomes \"S and proceed to Silent Study.\" \n\nThen, I check if there's a known waypoint that represents this action or location. Since \"Robot\" is a function, but it's not a waypoint. The next step is \"proceed\", which isn't a waypoint name either. So, perhaps I need to break down the command further.\n\nWait, maybe each part of the command corresponds to a waypoint? Let me see: \"S and proceed\" could mean the Silent Study area. Then wait for 10 minutes\u2014wait is a function but not a waypoint. Hmm, this might be ambiguous.\n\nBut according to the rules, if no known waypoint matches, I should return an action that says \"speak\" with the message about an invalid waypoint. So, in this case, since both parts are unclear and don't correspond to any known waypoint or functions beyond navigate, wait, etc., it's an unknown scenario.\n\nSo the output would be: actions is [\"speak\", \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"] but actually, no, because I have two commands here. Wait, maybe each part needs to be matched individually.\n\nWait, the command is \"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\" So, it's more of a series of actions than a single command with waypoints. But since only certain functions are supported (navigate, speak, wait), I have to process them step by step.\n\nFirst action: navigate from where? It says \"proceed\" first. Maybe that's a typo and should be the robot's location. So perhaps the user meant to go to Silent Study or another area. But without knowing the exact location of the robot, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Robot\" is the function itself, so navigate from there? Or does the user mean to move to where the robot is located and proceed to Silent Study? This part isn't clear enough for a proper waypoint match.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to return an action that says the input is invalid because it references unknown waypoints. So, \"speak\" with the message about not having any known waypoint to go from.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Robot' and 'proceed' are not valid waypoint names or steps.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
