    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the user's query. They've provided a prompt about navigating to certain zones and waiting. The task is to extract waypoints from this prompt using fuzzy matching.\n\nFirst, I need to normalize both the input and the waypoint list by converting them to lowercase. That way, variations like 'SILENT' or 'silent study' are treated the same.\n\nNext, trimming any extraneous tokens. Any token that starts with letters and is followed by numbers should be removed because they're likely not part of a valid identifier. For example, if there's a word like \"123Hello\", it would start with digits and thus be discarded.\n\nTokenizing both the normalized prompt and each waypoint into individual words. The normalized prompt from the user might have extra spaces or different punctuation, which I'll split correctly.\n\nFor similarity checking, I need to ensure that every token in any known waypoint appears in the normalized input. Alternatively, a high percentage (80% or more) of tokens should be present. This allows the input to include extra prefixes without affecting the match.\n\nLooking at the provided waypoints and their translations into JSON, each waypoint is represented as an object with \"name\", \"x\", and \"y\" fields. I'll compare each token from the normalized user prompt against these keys.\n\nIn this case, the user's prompt mentions 'Silent Study' and 'wait for 10 minutes.' The normalization step would process ' Silent Study' into 'silent study' and 'wait for 10 minutes' into 'wait for 10 minutes'. Checking each waypoint:\n\n1. **RoboHub Entrance**: If it's present in the normalized prompt, it will match.\n2. **Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic**: Similarly, its token is checked against the normalized prompt.\n\nI'll check if either of these waypoints have names that include 'silent study' or 'wait for'. None do, so none of the known waypoints are matched.\n\nSince no waypoint meets the similarity threshold, I need to return an action. The supported edge cases require a speak action with an error message since another function isn't requested beyond \"navigate\", which is covered in the allowed actions.\n\nPutting it all together, the response will be a JSON object indicating that the user hasn't provided a valid waypoint and needs to speak.\n</think>\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Normalization:** Convert both the user's input and each known waypoint name to lowercase to facilitate comparison.\n   \n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:** Remove tokens that are likely building codes or non-essential identifiers, such as those containing letters and digits at the beginning of the input.\n\n3. **Tokenization:** Split the normalized user input and each known waypoint name into individual words for comparison.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:** Assess whether every token from a known waypoint appears in the normalized user input (or if 80% or more tokens are present) to determine a match.\n   \n5. **Fallback:** If no known waypoint meets the similarity threshold, return an action indicating that a valid waypoint is not provided and the user needs to speak.\n\n### Solution\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The normalized input from the user's prompt, after tokenization and normalization, does not contain any known waypoints such as `RoboHub Entrance` or `Silent Study`.\n- Since no known waypoint meets the similarity threshold (e.g., 80% of its tokens must appear in the normalized input), an action indicating that a valid waypoint is not provided is returned.\n- The user is prompted to speak.",
