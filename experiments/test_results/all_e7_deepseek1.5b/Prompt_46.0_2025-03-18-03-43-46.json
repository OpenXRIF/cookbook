    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user wants to travel to the E5 Entrance and then go to the Microwaves. The available waypoints are like Coffee Area, Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic, RoboHub, etc. I should check if these places have known waypoint names that match E5 Entrance or Microwaves.\n\nE5 Entrance: Hmm, I'm not sure what's associated with E5. Maybe it's the room number in a building? But since we're looking for waypoints, maybe E5 is a specific place. If there's a waypoint named \"Room E5\", then that would be a match. But if not, perhaps \"E5 Entrance\" isn't one of the known waypoint names.\n\nMicrowaves: I know that microwaves are usually placed on floors, like Floor 6 or something in a lab, room numbers, etc. So maybe there's a waypoint named \"Floor 6\", but again, checking against the list would be important.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints:\n\n- Coffee Area (104)\n- Room 1427 - Ideas Club\n- RoboHub\n- E5 Entrance? Not sure if that's a waypoint.\n- Room X997 - Technology Building\n- E3 Lab - Maybe not, unless there's a waypoint named \"E3\".\n- E10 - Far East Office Building?\n- F4 - Far East Meeting Hall?\n- Room 1032 - Far East Meeting Hall?\n- E5 - Probably, maybe the room number.\n- Room X469 - Far East Office Building?\n\nWait, I don't see \"E5 Entrance\" as a waypoint. Maybe it's not available. Similarly, for Microwaves: Do any of these waypoints have names that include \"microwave\"?\n\nLooking back at the provided list:\n\nRoom 1032 is the Far East Meeting Hall. No microwave there. Room X469: not related. E5 Entrance? Probably not on the waypoint list.\n\nSo neither E5 Entrance nor Microwaves are known waypoints. That means I can't match these as valid waypoints, so they must be unknown. Therefore, I should respond with an action that says the request is invalid and provides an error message.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E5 Entrance' and 'Microwaves' are not valid waypoints.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
