    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The user wrote, \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\" Hmm, I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are these known waypoints like Coffee Area, D&D Entrance, D&D Zone, etc., but there's an unknown waypoint mentioned here. So, I think my first step is to check if \"unknown zone\" is a valid waypoint. If it's not, then the response should be something like \"invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n\nBut wait, what about the RoboHub? There are two known waypoints for that: Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic and Room 3055 - RoboHub. So, if I can reach either of those, maybe I don't need to worry about the unknown zone. But since the user specifically mentioned the unknown zone first, I should handle that part carefully.\n\nI think the best approach is to mention both waypoints for RoboHub and then clarify that there's an unknown zone that's not recognized. That way, the user knows they have options instead of being stuck on an invalid command.\n\nSo, my response would include a speak action with the input about going to either the Ideas Clinic or the RoboHub, followed by waiting for 10 seconds when meeting Zach. Also, I should note that the unknown zone is not recognized and ask if it's available.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Please go to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic or Room 3055 - RoboHub\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        }\n    ]\n}",
