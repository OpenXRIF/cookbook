For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's query. They want me to take them to the E7 silent study. Let me go through the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem. The user has a specific command they want to execute, and there are certain rules to follow. From the previous examples, it seems that I should navigate to the specified waypoint and perform actions along the way or at the target location.\n\nLooking back at the available waypoints, E7 silent study isn't listed in the functions. Wait, actually, I'm thinking about normalization steps. When matching waypoint names, both user input and known names are converted to lowercase. Also, any token that starts with letters is removed if it contains digits or vice versa.\n\nWait, but \"E7 silent study\" isn't a waypoint name, right? From the list of waypoints provided, I don't see one with E7 in the name. The closest is perhaps not listed. So, according to the handling of complex commands, if the command includes multiple steps and functions beyond \"navigate\", etc., it should output an action with an error.\n\nIn this case, the user's prompt is about taking them to an unknown waypoint. Looking at the supported edge cases, any waypoint that doesn't exist returns a speak action with input \"This waypoint does not exist\". So, since E7 silent study isn't a known waypoint and I can't find one, it should return that.\n\nI also need to consider if there are other waypoint names matching in lowercase. Checking each function's waypoint names:\n\n- Navigate: only the home location is specified.\n- speak: various locations like room 434, etc.\n- wait: multiple places listed, but again, E7 silent study isn't among them.\n\nSo, no known waypoint for E7 silent study, hence output actions as in supported edge cases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
