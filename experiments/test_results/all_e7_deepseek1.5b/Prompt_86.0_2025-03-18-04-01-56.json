    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt \"Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and wait 15 seconds.\" first. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the system has a predefined list of waypoint names. From the given examples, like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and \"C&D - Hot Food Area,\" it seems these are valid locations within each building. So, C&D - Hot Food Area should definitely exist in the known waypoints.\n\nThe user is instructing the robot to navigate to this specific area. I don't see any issues here with the waypoint name itself\u2014there's no doubt about what needs to be done. The robot can easily follow a known action like navigating to that particular location.\n\nNow, about waiting 15 seconds. From the prompt, it seems the user wants a fixed duration, so I should make sure the system accounts for that. The \"navigate\" function doesn't inherently handle time, but since the waypoint names are static, perhaps this can be achieved by specifying a time or by using another action before navigating. However, in this case, since we're only requesting to navigate, maybe it's just the command itself.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should include an action \"navigate\" with the input containing the location name. So, the output would be:\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nI don't see any issues here. The waypoint is valid, and there's no need for additional steps beyond the initial navigation command.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
