    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the prompt: \"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the available functions, we have navigate, speak, and wait. The command here is \"Robot,\" which suggests a navigation request. So, I should check if there's a waypoint named \"Robot\" that specifies a path or direction.\n\nReviewing the list of known waypoints, I see a waypoint called Silent Study with coordinates (435, 270). It doesn't specify a direction but just its location. That might not be enough because \"Robot\" could mean going in any direction from there.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. There's another waypoint calledsilent study that's lowercase, which I think is the normalized version of \"Silent Study.\" Looking through the known waypoints, Silent Study isn't present; it's Silent Study with lowercase letters. So no waypoint for Silent Study.\n\nSince none of the known waypoints mention a robot and its path or direction, the system shouldn't be able to navigate correctly. It should output an action suggesting that the command is invalid because there's no applicable waypoint.\n\nI need to ensure that this logic covers all possibilities: check normalization, tokenization, similarity without exact matches, fallback to speak if none match, and handle unsupported actions by showing a speak message with the error.\n\nAlright, putting it all together in code.\n</think>\n\nTo address the prompt \"Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes,\" we need to determine whether there is a known waypoint that represents the robot's movement. \n\nAfter reviewing the available waypoints:\n\n- **Silent Study** (lowercase) corresponds to a waypoint with coordinates (435, 270).\n- There are no waypoints named \"Robot\" or any waypoint that specifies direction or path.\n\nSince none of the known waypoints match the command \"Robot,\" we should output an action suggesting that the request is invalid.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Robot' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
