    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt using the provided fuzzy matching for waypoints. The prompt is: \"I need to take me two Shower A, then shower B. Wait 1 minute at shower B, then we can go.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into its components. There are three main actions mentioned: taking shower A and shower B. It also says \"take me two\" which might be a bit confusing because of the \"me.\" Maybe it's just \"two shower\" or something else.\n\nLooking at the known waypoint names from the prompt history, I see terms like \"Caffeine Concentration Zone,\" \"Dietary Intake Zone,\" etc. These don't seem to relate directly to shower areas. So, none of the predefined waypoints match this command.\n\nNext, I'll consider the functions available: Navigate, speak, and wait. The user is asking for taking two showers and waiting, so maybe it's about navigating to specific locations or speaking instructions. But since there are no known waypoints that fit, I need a fallback.\n\nThe user also mentioned using left-to-right processing unless specified otherwise. So, I'll process each part of the instruction in order: take shower A, then shower B, wait for one minute at shower B, and go.\n\nI'll list out the possible actions in the order they should be taken:\n1. Navigate to Shower A.\n2. Take shower A.\n3. Wait 1 minute at shower B while taking shower A is already done.\n4. Navigate to shower B.\n5. Take shower B.\n6. Speak to someone or wait as per instructions.\n\nWait, but according to the supported actions section, if any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, I should return an error. Here, it's a combination of navigating and taking actions which might be beyond just those three functions.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to output an action with \"speak\" since the user is asking for instructions. But I'm not sure if that falls under the supported functions or if it's considered invalid because it involves more than just the three functions.\n\nLooking back at the edge cases, if a waypoint isn't known and multiple interpretations are possible, choose the one that minimizes backtracking. In this case, since no waypoints match, maybe I should suggest speaking as the fallback action but include an error message about the unknown request.\n\nSo, the actions would be navigate to shower A, take shower A, wait for a minute at shower B while taking shower A is done, navigate to shower B, take shower B, and then speak. But since we can't perform all these actions directly, I'll have to find the right way to express this in the supported functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just output \"speak\" with an action input that says it's invalid because of the unknown request. That would comply with the supported function rules but handle the error case as per the edge cases section.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"This request is about navigating to shower areas and waiting, which may be beyond our supported functions.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
