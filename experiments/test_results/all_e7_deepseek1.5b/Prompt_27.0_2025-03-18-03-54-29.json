    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this user prompt step by step. The user wants me to take them to the elevators, wait for 15 seconds there, and then let's find the East Enterance.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoint names like \"Elevators\" or \"East Enterance\", none of which seem directly related to elevators. So I can't proceed with that. \n\nNext, the user mentioned waiting their specific for 15 seconds. Since this is a direct request about time and waiting, but there's no known waypoint named \"Wait\" in the list provided, I have to handle that as an unsupported action.\n\nI should output an action where \"speak\" is used with an error message because the command isn't supported beyond what's available.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'wait' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
