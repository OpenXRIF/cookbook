    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says the room is too loud, so they want to go to Silent Study first, then afterwards check out RoboHub. \n\nFirst, I should look at the available waypoints in the list. Silent Study isn't listed here, so it's probably not a known waypoint. That means the app should respond that it doesn't recognize the unknown input.\n\nI also need to make sure about handling commands step by step. The command mentions going to Silent Study first and then RoboHub afterward. So, I'll have two actions: one for Silent Study and another for RoboHub.\n\nSince Silent Study isn't a known waypoint, it will be flagged as invalid. For the RoboHub request, it's valid because there's an entry with room 1427 - Ideas Clinic at x=25, y=75. So, I can navigate to that location and wait for 10 seconds.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions will be navigate to Silent Study (even though it's invalid), then speak to request RoboHub, navigate again to its location, and wait there. The input will include a message about checking out RoboHub afterward.\n</think>\n\nTo address this command, we'll guide the user step by step through their request.\n\n1. **Check for Valid Waypoints**: \n   - Silent Study is not listed as a known waypoint.\n\n2. **Processing Commands**:\n   - After identifying that Silent Study isn't valid, proceed to navigate to RoboHub's location.\n   - Request an action: \"check out RoboHub\".\n\n3. **Final Actions**:\n   - Navigate to the correct location for RoboHub.\n   - Wait for 10 seconds at its location.\n\n**Actions**: \n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Check out RoboHub afterwards.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        }\n    ]\n}",
