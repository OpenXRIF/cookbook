    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to translate this user prompt into a set of actions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the prompt says: \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then shower B. Wait 1 minute at shower B, then we can go.\" Hmm, that seems like a series of steps they want me to take. I remember from previous examples that each action needs to be a specific move or command, and the way they're connected matters.\n\nSo, starting with \"freshen up,\" it's probably asking for a rest area, maybe a shower. The user mentions shower A first, then shower B. After shower B, they want to go somewhere else after waiting for a minute. I think the \"go\" part might be referring to moving around or exploring another area.\n\nLooking back at the available functions, we have navigate, speak, and wait. Navigation is about getting from one place to another, which seems applicable here because they're taking me through different places. Speaking would be if someone else was asking for instructions, but in this case, it's more like being there to go around.\n\nWait, does the user want me to be present at shower A and then shower B? Or is it about moving from one location to another? The prompt says \"take me to shower A, then shower B,\" so maybe I need to go into both showers. After showering B, they wait for a minute before going somewhere else.\n\nThe available functions include navigate, which would move me around, speak if someone needs my help or information, and wait for 1 minute. So the action sequence could be: navigate to shower A (20 minutes), then navigate to shower B (another 30 minutes). After showering B, wait for a minute, and then go back to where I was after showering B.\n\nWait, but \"go\" might not mean going all the way back. It could just mean continuing from where they left off, like moving around or exploring further. So maybe it's navigate again or explore another area while waiting for the minute.\n\nPutting it together, each action is a specific move: navigate, speak, wait. The user wants me to go through showers and wait for a minute at one point before leaving. So I'll have two navigate actions, then speak for the wait, and another navigate or exploration after that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Shower A\",\n                \"x\": 10,\n                \"y\": 25\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Shower B\",\n                \"x\": 20,\n                \"y\": 40\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey, I'm here to help with showering!\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 247 - shower area\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
