    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user gave me this prompt to parse and figure out how to handle it. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the query is about showering with multiple steps. The task involves identifying each waypoint and ensuring all commands are followed correctly. It mentions \" shower A\" and \"SHower B\", so I need to check if those names exist in the known waypoints.\n\nLooking at the available waypoint names, there's a list of places like C, D areas, Coffee Area, etc. But neither Shower A nor Shower B are listed here. That means my first step is to check if these are unknown waypoints.\n\nThe instructions say that if a waypoint isn't found, I should output an action saying \"This waypoint does not exist\". So in this case, since Shower A and shower B aren't known, the response needs to inform the user that there's nothing available for those commands.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following the guidelines properly. The functions allowed are navigate, speak, and wait. Since the query is about multiple steps without any function calls beyond what's given, it falls under supported actions. But since some waypoints aren't found, the action should include the error message as per the rules.\n\nI think that's all for this prompt. It seems straightforward once I identify which waypoints to look for and apply the fuzzy matching rules.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: ' shower A' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
