    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to translate this prompt into a set of actions. The user wants me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, there's an \"E5 Entrance\" and maybe some Micawave-related ones. Wait, no micawaves are mentioned explicitly. But in the examples, they showed using a waypoint called Shower A which was similar to a microwave.\n\nSo I think I'll treat the user's input as a waypoint if it's named something similar. Since \"E5 Entrance\" is already a known waypoint, that will be my first action: navigate to E5 Entrance.\n\nAfter arriving there, the next step is to find the Microwaves. But since there are no specific micawave waypoints listed, I'll assume that finding any microwave in a room would do. So I'll just have the user speak instructions like \"find microwaves\" and wait for them once found.\n\nPutting it all together, my actions should include navigating to E5 Entrance and then instructing the user to find microwaves and wait.\n</think>\n\n{\"actions\": [\n    {\n        \"action\": \"navigate\",\n        \"input\": {\n            \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n            \"x\": 0.0,\n            \"y\": 0.0\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"find microwaves\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"action\": \"wait\",\n        \"input\": 1\n    }\n]}",
