    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle this command where the user says \"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the examples provided, when a robot is asked to go to a specific location like C&D - Coffee Area or RoboHub Entrance, that's a direct navigate action. So in this case, the user wants the robot to move to the Assembly Room waypoint and then state its name upon arriving. \n\nHmm, but wait\u2014how does that work? The command says \"move to,\" which implies moving through an area until it reaches the target point. Then, after arriving, the user wants it to output the same name as the waypoint. But how can a robot know what the name is before it arrives? Because the waypoint's name isn't specified here; instead, it's just the name of that specific location.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided, I don't see \"Assembly Room\" listed. The closest are places like Ideas Clinic and RoboHub, which have their own names in parentheses. For example, C&D - Coffee Area is named with (C&D), so maybe the waypoint's name includes the location and some code.\n\nBut if a user wants the robot to state its waypoint name upon arrival, they're essentially asking for both movement and identification of that location. Since all the waypoints provided don't include \"Assembly Room,\" perhaps this command isn't possible or doesn't match any known waypoint.\n\nI remember in the earlier steps, when processing commands, we look for exact matches based on waypoint names. If none are found, we output an action with an error message. So in this case, since there's no waypoint named \"Assembly Room\" or its name includes it, the command should trigger a speak action with the message indicating that it's invalid.\n\nWait, but the waypoint might have multiple parts. For instance, C&D - Coffee Area is (C&D) followed by \"-Coffee Area.\" So maybe the entire name is considered as part of the waypoint. If \"Assembly Room\" isn't listed anywhere, then any mention of it would be treated as an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo in this case, since there's no such waypoint, the robot can't move to it or state its name upon arrival because none exist. That means the appropriate response is a speak action with an error message explaining that \"unknown zone\" isn't recognized.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Assembly Room' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
