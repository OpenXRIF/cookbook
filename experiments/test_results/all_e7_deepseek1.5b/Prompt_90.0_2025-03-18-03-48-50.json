    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to help the user with their command. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided a set of waypoints and some examples. They also explained an advanced fuzzy matching method for waypoint names. The task is to process a given prompt and generate appropriate actions like \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\".\n\nThe specific query is: \"Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly.\" \n\nLooking at the example prompts, I see that when a robot command is issued, it needs to navigate to the specified waypoint. The waypoint in question here is \"C&D - Hot Food Area\". So, I should check if this is one of the known waypoints.\n\nFrom the given list of waypoint names:\n\n- C&D Coffee Area\n- C&D Hot Food Area\n- C&D Hot Food Zone (which might be a typo)\n- C&D Coffee Zone\n- RoboHub Entrance\n\nWait, in the user's prompt, it's \"C&D - Hot Food Area\". So that's exactly one of the waypoint names listed. Great!\n\nNow, I need to determine the correct action. Since it's a robot command asking to navigate to a specific area and announce clearly, I should plan both the navigation and the announcement.\n\nFirst, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area. Then, from there, announce \"C&D Hot Food Area\" in a clear manner. \n\nI also need to consider any additional actions or commands that might be involved. The user didn't specify multiple steps beyond navigating and announcing, so maybe just those two actions are sufficient.\n\nWait, does the announcement require a specific input? Maybe it needs an action after navigating, which would be the \"speak\" action with the announced phrase as the input.\n\nSo putting it together, the robot should navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and then speak clearly about that area. \n\nI need to make sure I'm following the fuzzy matching rules correctly. Both the user's input (the command) and the waypoint name are in lowercase, which is normalized. So \"C&D Hot Food Area\" matches exactly with the waypoint name.\n\nNo extraneous tokens to remove since it's straightforward. The words are all present and in order.\n\nSo, my output should have two actions: one for navigating and another for speaking the announced phrase. That seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 25\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"C&D Hot Food Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
