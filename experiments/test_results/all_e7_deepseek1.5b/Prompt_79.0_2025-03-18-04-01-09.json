    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says the user wants to go to the vending machines and then get them some lays bbq chips. \n\nFirst, I should check if \"vending machines\" is a known waypoint. Looking back at the list of waypoints, none of them mention anything about vending machines. So that's probably not an available option.\n\nNext, the command mentions getting \"lays bbq chips,\" which sounds like a specific item. I don't see any waypoint named \"bbq chips\" in the provided data either. This might be tricky because it could be ambiguous or unclear what exactly is being asked for.\n\nSince neither \"vending machines\" nor \"bbq chips\" are waypoints, and without more context about how to get these items, I can't map this out to a known action. The user isn't asking directly about the location of these chips; they're just requesting them.\n\nSo, based on the guidelines provided, if neither waypoint is found, and there's ambiguity or unclear command, the appropriate response is to output an action with \"speak\" and the message indicating that the request doesn't exist. \n\nI should also make sure I'm following the advanced fuzzy matching steps because it seems like a high percentage of tokens might be present in any possible waypoint description. This means even though neither term exists as a keyword, the system could match based on other interpretations or additional context.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that \"lays bbq chips\" could mean something else entirely, maybe even an attempt to access a specific location within the application's codebase. Without more details, it's hard to know what exactly is being asked for.\n\nPutting this together, I think the best course of action is to inform the user that their request isn't recognized and offers a straightforward response with a specific message. This way, they're informed without getting stuck in a loop where further questions are needed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'lays bbq chips' is not a valid waypoint or command\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
