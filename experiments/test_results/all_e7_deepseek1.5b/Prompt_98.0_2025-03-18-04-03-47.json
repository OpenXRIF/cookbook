    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this request where the user says something like, \"Robot, proceed to [Elevators], say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation, and wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\" Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, let me break down what the user is asking for. They want a robot to perform several actions: go to a specific location called Elevators, explain it as if they're guiding someone (which makes sense since robots are like humans), and then wait for 5 minutes before proceeding. I need to make sure that the robot can understand this instruction and execute each part correctly.\n\nI remember from the previous examples that the user prompt is normalized by converting everything to lowercase. So, \"Elevators\" becomes \"elevators.\" Then, any extra tokens at the beginning are removed. In this case, there aren't any extra tokens like building codes or numbers at the start, so I can keep it as \"elevators.\"\n\nNext, tokenization is needed. I'll split both the user's instruction and the known waypoint names into individual words. The user's instruction is a single string: \"Robot, proceed to [Elevators], say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation, and wait for 5 minutes before moving on.\" When normalized, it becomes \"proceed to elevators,\" and after tokenizing, the parts are:\n\n1. Robot\n2. proceed\n3. to\n4. elevators\n\nThen, I have several known waypoint names that the robot should check against. The relevant one here is probably 'elevators' as a waypoint name. So, I need to compare each part of the user's instruction with these waypoints.\n\nLooking at the normalized words:\n\n- \"proceed\" vs. \"elevators\"\n- \"to\" vs. \"elevators\"\n- \"elevators\" directly\n- \"say\" vs. any known waypoint\n- \"navigation\" isn't a waypoint I'm aware of.\n- \"wait\" vs. any waypoint\n\nSo, the relevant waypoints here are 'elevators' and maybe others if they're similar. But from the previous examples, it seems that only exact matches or high enough similarity in tokens would count.\n\nFor each part:\n\n1. \"proceed to elevators\": The robot's known waypoint is 'elevators'. Does the user have a waypoint named 'proceed'? I don't think so. So this might not match.\n2. 'to' elevators: Not present, as there's no waypoint named 'to' or 'to elevators'.\n3. Elevators directly matches the waypoint name.\n\nSo, only one waypoint is matching here: 'elevators'. The user has a part that needs to be navigated to, which should be matched by this waypoint. \n\nThe action needed would be navigate because the robot is moving from its current position (probably starting at the base) to the elevators zone for assistance with navigation and then wait for 5 minutes.\n\nWait, but in the example provided earlier, when navigating to a waypoint named 'C&D - Coffee Area', that was handled by checking if every token was present. So, maybe just having one exact match is sufficient because even if there are extra words (like 'proceed'), it's considered as part of the input.\n\nSo, the output would be a single action: navigate to elevators. That makes sense because the user provided that waypoint name in their instruction.\n\nI should also make sure that any other waypoints are not being triggered but instead only focus on this one since the user specifically mentioned 'elevators'. \n\nTherefore, I think the robot should execute the 'navigate' function with the waypoint named elevators. This way, it performs all the required actions as per the user's prompt without getting confused by other waypoints.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to guide a robot to an elevator zone and wait there for 5 minutes. Here's how it will be handled:\n\n1. **Normalization**: Convert both inputs to lowercase: \"elevators\" and \"proceed to elevators\".\n2. **Tokenization**:\n   - User instruction: [\"proceed\", \"to\", \"elevators\"]\n   - waypoint name: [\"elevators\"]\n\n3. **Matching**:\n   - \"proceed\" is not a known waypoint.\n   - \"to elevators\": Not present as a known waypoint.\n   - \"elevators\": Matches the known waypoint.\n\n4. **Action Execution**:\n   - Navigate to the 'elevators' waypoint.\n   - Wait for 5 minutes at 'elevators'.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Elevators\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 25\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"elevators\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
