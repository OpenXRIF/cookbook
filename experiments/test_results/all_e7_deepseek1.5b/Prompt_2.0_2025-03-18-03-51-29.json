    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a detailed prompt about handling different types of commands and waypoint matching. They want me to write an AI that can process these prompts by matching waypoint names and executing actions based on their commands.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the given data. There are several waypoints defined with their locations, functions, and descriptions. The user provided examples where they request waypoints and handle complex commands involving multiple steps. My task is to create an AI that can process these requests by either matching a known waypoint or handling ambiguities.\n\nThe prompt includes two main parts: understanding user prompts and handling complex commands. For the first part, I need to normalize both the input and each known waypoint, remove extraneous tokens, tokenize them, and then check for similarity. If a waypoint matches well enough, it's considered a match; otherwise, the function is selected from \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\".\n\nIn the complex commands section, I have to process steps in order unless specified otherwise. For example, if a command has multiple parts, each action should be handled sequentially. If there are ambiguities, I choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\nLooking at the example given: a user requests navigating to a zone, then to a room. The AI processes each step and executes the actions accordingly. If a waypoint is unknown, it returns an action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nNow, applying this to the task at hand: \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\" I need to break this down into two separate navigate requests. Each request should be processed individually, ensuring that each step is followed correctly.\n\nI'll start by identifying the waypoint for \"Ideas Clinic\" from the provided data. Then, create a command to navigate there. Next, do the same for \"Assembly Room.\"\n\nEach action will involve specifying the waypoint's location and coordinates. For navigation, I might also need to ensure that the user knows how to input these locations.\n\nPotential issues could be: mismatches in waypoint names due to case sensitivity or case variations. Since both input and waypoint names are normalized to lowercase, this should mitigate some issues. But I'll have to make sure that all waypoints' lowercase versions match exactly after normalization.\n\nAnother consideration is the order of execution. The commands should be processed one after another, so each navigate command must be correctly handled in sequence without any errors affecting the next step.\n\nIf either waypoint isn't found, the action is \"speak\" with an error message. If a function beyond the three required is used, it's handled as a support message.\n\nI also need to consider that sometimes waypoints might have multiple names or descriptions. For example, if there are alternative names for places, I should check all possible options and perhaps prioritize based on order of definition or other criteria.\n\nIn summary, the AI will handle each step separately, normalize inputs, tokenize, compare waypoint names, execute commands in sequence, and provide appropriate actions based on the similarity thresholds.\n</think>\n\nTo process the command \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room,\" we need to break it down into two separate navigate requests. Each request will be processed individually, ensuring that each step is followed correctly.\n\n1. **First Navigate Request: Ideas Clinic**\n   - **Action:** `navigate`\n   - **Input:** A waypoint named \"Ideas Clinic\" with its location and coordinates.\n     - Ensure the input matches exactly after normalization to avoid any mismatches due to case sensitivity or other differences in naming.\n\n2. **Second Navigate Request: Assembly Room**\n   - **Action:** `navigate`\n   - **Input:** A waypoint named \"Assembly Room\" with its location and coordinates.\n\nBy handling each navigate request separately, we ensure that the user's instructions are executed correctly, following the specified sequence of steps without any ambiguity or backtracking.",
