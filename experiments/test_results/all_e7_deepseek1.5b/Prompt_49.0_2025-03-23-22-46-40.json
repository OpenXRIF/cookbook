For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 49.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Using the provided system's rules for matching waypoints. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. The user wants to navigate from the E5 Entrance to the Microwaves waypoint. So, I need to check if both these waypoints exist in the known list and see how well they match the user's query.\n\nFrom the initial prompt, I recall that each waypoint has a name, location (x, y coordinates), and type of command. The user input for this problem is a general request: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" \n\nLet me go through the known waypoints:\n\n1. **Assembly Room**: This seems like a general workspace for manufacturing or repair, located at (1865, 434). It's a specific location but not directly related to navigating from one place to another.\n\n2. **Shower B**: Located at (827, 610), it's an individual shower. Not relevant here since the user is asking for movement between two places.\n\n3. **Microwaves**: This waypoint seems to be where microwave ovens are typically found, I think. Its location might be somewhere else, but from the given information, it's at (2589, 607). The user wants to find this after traveling to E5 Entrance.\n\n4. **RoboHub**: Positioned at (102, 30), which is another workspace for robots and programming. Not directly related to the user's request.\n\n5. **Shower A**: Located at (826, 611). Similar to Shower B but slightly different coordinates.\n\nSo, both E5 Entrance and Microwaves are specific waypoints. Let me check if they match when the user says \"Travel to...\" \n\nFirst, I need to see if \"E5 Entrance\" exists as a waypoint. Looking back at the available waypoints: Assembly Room is at (1865,434), Shower B is at (827,610). Hmm, no waypoint named E5 Entrance in the list. The closest is the shower area near 827 on y-axis, but that's shower B.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The known waypoints are:\n\n- **Assembly Room**: Name: ?, location (1865,434)\n- **Shower B**: name unknown? Or perhaps \"Shower B\" is a waypoint?\n- **Microwave**: No waypoint named Microwave.\n- **RoboHub**: name RoboHub, but not exactly the E5 Entrance.\n\nWait, from the given data, the known waypoints are: Assembly Room (1865,434), Shower B at 827,610,microwave at 2589,607, RoboHub at 102,30. There's no E5 Entrance listed as a waypoint.\n\nSo, the user's query is to travel from the E5 Entrance to the Microwaves. Since there's no waypoint named E5 Entrance in the available list, that becomes an issue.\n\nLet me go through the steps:\n\nNormalization: User input is \"E5 Entrance\". Whwaypoint name is also \"E5 Entrance\".\n\nExtraneous tokens removal: Both are simple names with letters and digits at start? Not sure. shower B is \"Shower B\", which doesn't start with a letter followed by numbers.\n\nTokenization: user's input and each waypoint.\n\nSimilarity calculation: For the user's query, if E5 Entrance isn't in known waypoints, but it's near Shower B at (827,610). Since shower B is present, perhaps it can be considered as part of the path. But the user specifically mentions E5 Entrance, which is not a waypoint.\n\nSo, maybe the user is asking to go to shower B and then to microwave? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the user said \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" So it's two separate waypoints. But if neither E5 Entrance nor Microwave are known waypoints, that's a problem.\n\nBut wait, the provided waypoints don't include \"E5 Entrance\". The closest is shower B at (827,610), but I think that's not the same as E5 Entrance.\n\nSo, perhaps there are no known waypoints for E5 Entrance or Microwave. Hence, the user's request can't be fulfilled with existing knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the system should respond with an action indicating that the waypoint does not exist, along with an error message about unknown locations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E5 Entrance' is not a known waypoint.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
