    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle the prompt \"Let's check out Novelties store, and then head out South Entrance.\" First, I need to break this down. It seems like there are two main tasks mentioned: checking out Novelties store and heading out to South Entrance.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I see there's a \"Microwaves\" waypoint with name 1817 and description. But wait, I don't have the actual location for Microwaves yet. Hmm, maybe that's an issue.\n\nNext, the user wants to go to Novelties store first. I check the waypoint list. There's a \"Cafes\" waypoint at 0.0 coordinates. I think that's where a caf\u00e9 is located, so going there makes sense for checking out a novel spot. So, the action here would be \"navigate\" with name \"C&D - Caf\u00e9\" and maybe some x and y values.\n\nThen, after that, heading out to the South Entrance. From the user prompt, I see there's a \"South Entrance\" waypoint. Let me check its details. It has name 0.0. Wait, is that correct? Maybe it should be a different name or location. Also, looking back, I found a \"Microwaves\" waypoint but didn't find a \"South Entrance\" one.\n\nI need to make sure the Southwest Foundation supports this action and function combination. The example shows navigation and speaking, so if \"navigate\" is supported, then that should work. But without the exact location for South Entrance, maybe it's an unknown waypoint. That could mean no match is found, leading to a speak action error.\n\nWait, also, I have a \"Microwaves\" waypoint but didn't see \"South Entrance.\" Maybe there's another waypoint with that name or location elsewhere. I'll need to check the data again for more info on South Entrance.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the steps are: navigate to Caf\u00e9, then navigate to South Entrance. If both exist, apply the actions accordingly. If not, handle as an unknown.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Caf\u00e9\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"South Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 0.0,\n        \"y\": 0.0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, but I don't have the exact location for \"South Entrance\" in my data. It might be an unknown waypoint.\n\nAnother issue: I found a \"Microwaves\" waypoint but not \"South Entrance.\" Maybe that's another waypoint with similar name structure? Or perhaps it's supposed to be the same as \"Caf\u00e9s\"?\n\nI need more information on the coordinates or names for each waypoint, especially for \"Microwaves\" and \"South Entrance.\"\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the Southwest Foundation supports both \"navigate\" and \"speak\" functions in this context.\n\nIf \"Microwaves\" is the correct action but it's not available here, then perhaps there's a miscommunication. It might be better to select \"Microwaves\" if applicable or default to an error message otherwise.",
