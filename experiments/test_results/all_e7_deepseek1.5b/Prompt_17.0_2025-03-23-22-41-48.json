For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I'm fealing peckish.

    "Prompt": "\"I'm fealing peckish. Can we swing by the C&D - Snack Area and then grab a drink at the C&D - Cold Drink Aeria?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle this specific user prompt using the given rules. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user says: \"I'm feeling peckish. Can we swing by the C&D - Snack Area and then grab a drink at the C&D - Cold Drink Aeria?\" \n\nLooking at the waypoint names, there are two parts here: C&D - Snack Area and C&D - Cold Drink Aeria. I'll check if these are valid waypoints from the list provided.\n\nFrom the prompt history, I remember that the waypoint names have specific structures. The words before \"Area\" (like C&D) might be part of a larger name, but it's important to see if they exactly match any known waypoint name without extra prefixes or codes.\n\nThe first waypoint is \"C&D - Snack Area.\" Checking the list, I don't see this exact string except that it includes parts like \"Snack,\" which isn't present. So I'll have to see if there's a waypoint with \"Snack\" in it. Scanning through, I don't find any waypoint names that include \"Snack.\" The closest is \"Shower B\" but that doesn't match.\n\nThe second part is \"C&D - Cold Drink Aeria.\" Again, this has \"Drink,\" which isn't a term from the list except for things like \"Shower B\" might relate to a similar context. But again, it's not present. I don't see any waypoint names with \"Cold Drink.\"\n\nSince neither of these parts are found in the known waypoint list, the first step is to check if the user has provided an unknown waypoint. According to the rules, when a waypoint isn't found, the system should respond with an action that says this waypoint does not exist.\n\nSo, I need to make sure my fuzzy matching process covers this scenario. First, normalize both inputs by lowercasing, then remove any tokens that are building codes or appear at the beginning without being part of an essential identifier. \n\nIn this case, \"Feeling peckish\" is unrelated and doesn't match a known waypoint. The first part of the query mentions C&D - Snack Area, which after normalization becomes \"cd snack area.\" Comparing this to each waypoint's name, none of them have \"Snack,\" so it likely doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the system should respond with an action saying that \"unknown waypoint\" doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user is asking for a command involving unknown waypoints. Let's process the prompt step by step:\n\n1. **Check if both parts are known waypoints:**\n   - The first part is \"C&D - Snack Area.\"\n     - Normalized as \"cd snack area.\"\n     - No waypoint matches this, so it's invalid.\n   - The second part is \"C&D - Cold Drink Aeria.\"\n     - Normalized as \"cd cold drink era.\"\n     - Also no waypoint matches.\n\n2. **Determine if the waypoint names exist:**\n   - Since neither waypoint exists in the list, there are no valid waypoints to match.\n\n3. **Handle unknown commands:**\n   - According to the rules, when a single waypoint is not found, output an action with \"speak\" and the input as \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
