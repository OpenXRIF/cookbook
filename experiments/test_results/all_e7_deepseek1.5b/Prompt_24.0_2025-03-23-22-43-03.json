For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study's.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study's.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user gave me a prompt about moving to the RoboHub and then proceeding to the Silent Study's. I need to translate that into the available waypoint commands.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the example responses, it seems like each action is either navigating to a location, speaking to someone, or waiting for something. So, breaking down the prompt: \"move to RoboHub\" would be a navigate command, and then \"proceed to Silent Study's.\" I need to check if there's a waypoint named \"Silent Study's.\" Wait, that doesn't sound right because the waypoint names are in lowercase without any prefixes or suffixes. \n\nI see that there was a waypoint called \"Shower B\" mentioned earlier, but that's just an example. Looking back at the known waypoints, none of them mention \"Silent Study's\" as a location. The available functions include navigate, speak, and wait. So, if I can't find a direct way to move to \"Silent Study's,\" maybe I should prompt the user for clarification or inform them that it's not an existing waypoint.\n\nIn terms of handling commands with multiple steps, each action has its own priority unless specified otherwise. Since moving is straightforward (navigate), and then proceeding might need more processing, but since there's no corresponding waypoint, perhaps waiting isn't enough either. So, the response would involve speaking to inform the user about the unknown location.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the appropriate actions are to navigate to RoboHub, wait for confirmation if needed, and mention that Silent Study's is not a known waypoint.\n</think>\n\nTo address the request of moving to the RoboHub and proceeding to the Silent Study's., we need to determine if there's a corresponding waypoint.\n\n1. **Navigate:** There is no waypoint named \"RoboHub\" in lowercase with any relevant structure, so navigating isn't possible.\n2. **Wait for confirmation:** To handle ambiguity, a wait action may be needed before confirming further steps.\n3. **Inform the user:** Since Silent Study's isn't a known waypoint, we should inform them that it doesn't exist.\n\n**Final Actions:**\n\n- Navigate to RoboHub (since there's no direct way due to unknown waypoint)\n- Wait for confirmation\n- Informed by speaker\n\nThe actions are structured as:\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": { \"name\": \"RoboHub\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Cannot navigate to RoboHub, proceed with confirmation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}",
