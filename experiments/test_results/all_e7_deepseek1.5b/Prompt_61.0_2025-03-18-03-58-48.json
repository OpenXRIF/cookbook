    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond when someone asks, \"Please go to the E7 silent study.\" First, I need to understand what the system can do. The user provided some guidelines on matching waypoints and handling commands.\n\nThe first step is normalizing both inputs by converting them to lowercase. So, if the input is \"E7 silent study,\" it becomes \"e7 silent study.\" Each waypoint name should also be normalized similarly. But in this case, since we're just asking about a specific location, I don't need to match any known waypoints because there isn't one named E7 silent study.\n\nNext, removing extraneous tokens. That means if the input has something like \"e7,\" it's part of the waypoint name and should be kept. However, in this case, since we're just going to a specific location, I don't need to worry about that here.\n\nTokenization is the next step. Both the user's query and any known waypoints are split into individual words. In this example, there aren't any known waypoints listed, so that part doesn't apply here.\n\nThe similarity calculation is then done by checking if all tokens of the waypoint name appear in the input. Since we're not matching any known waypoints, I need to check if the entire query can be processed without needing a waypoint match. But since it's just asking for a location, it seems straightforward.\n\nSince there are no known waypoints that match this request, the system falls into the \"unknown waypoint\" case. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown, the response should be an action where the input is specified as \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, the response is an action that says \"speak\" with the input being \"This waypoint does not exist.\" This ensures that someone can't proceed to go to E7 silent study because it's not a known waypoint.\n</think>\n\nThe user is requesting to \"take me to the E7 silent study,\" which is not recognized as a valid waypoint. Therefore, the system responds by indicating that this specific location is unknown.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
