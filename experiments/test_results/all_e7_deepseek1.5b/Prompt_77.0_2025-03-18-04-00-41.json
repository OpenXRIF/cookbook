    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The user has given a detailed set of waypoints for different zones in a building, including things like Snack Area, Cold Drink Area, Pastry Area, Coffee Area, and Hot Food Area. They want me to process a command that involves moving between these areas and ensuring certain actions are taken at each.\n\nSo, the prompt is asking about robot commands where the robot needs to start at C&D - Snack Area, inspect for spills or trash, then go to C&D - Cold Drink Area, ensure all drinks are properly stocked, next move to C&D - Pastry Area, check for expired products, visit Coffee Area for cleanliness, and finally go to Hot Food Area for sanitization before returning to the base station.\n\nFirst, I need to recognize that this is a complex command involving multiple waypoints and specific actions. The user wants the robot to perform several tasks sequentially: starting at Snack Area, then Cold Drink, Pastry, Coffee, and finally Hot Food. Each of these has its own requirements for safety and cleanliness.\n\nI should consider if the available functions in the system include movement commands and task-specific actions. The functions are Navigate, speak, and wait. So, I can't directly control the robot to move through specific zones unless it's programmed to navigate there.\n\nLooking at the known waypoints: C&D - Snack Area, C&D - Cold Drink Area, C&D - Pastry Area, C&D - Coffee Area, and C&D - Hot Food Area are all valid. Each has their own specifications like x and y coordinates for position and names for location.\n\nTo handle this command, I need to break it down into steps. The robot should start at Snack Area, then move to Cold Drink, then Pastry, then Coffee, then Hot Food, and finally return home. At each step, the robot must perform specific actions: inspect spills, stock drinks properly, check expired products, ensure cleanliness, sanitize surfaces for food storage.\n\nI also need to think about how to handle any unexpected commands that don't match the known waypoints. If the user tries to go directly to a zone without checking, I should respond by informing them it's an unknown waypoint and provide an action message.\n\nSince the functions include navigate, which is necessary to move between zones, but speak and wait are for higher-level tasks like asking questions or waiting for specific individuals. So, in this case, navigate is needed for movement between waypoints. But if the user just gives a location without context, I should avoid assuming any action unless there's an implied task.\n\nIn summary, I'll need to map each waypoint to its specific actions and structure the response with multiple actions corresponding to each zone visited, ensuring each step is handled correctly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Snack Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"inspect\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"waypoint\": \"C&D - Snack Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"stock\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"waypoint\": \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"check expired\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"waypoint\": \"C&D - Pastry Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"ensure cleanliness\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"waypoint\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"sanitize\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"waypoint\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Home Base Station\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
