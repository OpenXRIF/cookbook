    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out what action to take based on the user's message: \"I could really go for a shower.\" First off, I recognize that this sounds like an order or request. It doesn't specify exactly what to do yet, but it does mention the user wants someone to help with a shower.\n\nLooking at the available functions from the system\u2014navigate, speak, and wait\u2014I need to see which one fits best here. The message is a sentence without any commands, so maybe I should just listen or ask for clarification. Since there's no specific action requested beyond the request itself, it might be better to let go of speaking unless needed.\n\nI also check if \"speak\" is an allowed function, but since the user hasn't specified a particular action like navigating something or asking someone directly, maybe just waiting isn't the right choice here. Wait, hold on\u2014the system's available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. Since there's no need to go anywhere, perhaps just waiting is appropriate because the user wants help, not an action that requires moving around.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about how exactly to implement the \"speak\" function here. If the message doesn't include any commands beyond being polite, maybe it should wait instead of engaging in any conversation. That way, the system can handle the request without doing anything unnecessary.\n\nI also think about the edge cases mentioned earlier. Since this isn't a command with multiple steps or ambiguities, I can proceed to output just the speak action without adding extra actions. So, the final action would be to wait, allowing the user to proceed with their shower request as needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": {}\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
