    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's query about going for a shower. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided, there are defined waypoints like C&D - Coffee Area and others. But none of them seem related to personal activities or grooming. So, I should check if \"shower\" is among the known waypoint names.\n\nWait, in the initial description, the user provided a list of waypoints but didn't include any terms related to showering. The waypoint names are structured with specific roles and locations, not commands or actions.\n\nNext, according to the rules outlined for fuzzy matching, I need to normalize the inputs by converting them to lowercase. But \"shower\" is already in lowercase, so that's straightforward.\n\nThen, I have to look at each known waypoint to see if it matches the user's request. Since there are no waypoints named after personal activities or grooming, this seems like a dead end. \n\nLooking further into handling complex commands and edge cases, since the user isn't providing any of the known waypoint names, they're likely looking for a basic action\u2014like speaking. The system should recognize that and respond by acting as a speak function with an appropriate input.\n\nI also have to consider if there are any supported actions beyond navigate, speak, or wait. Since the user didn't specify another action, but just asked for shower, it's safe to default to speak here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I should instruct the system to handle this request as a basic action and provide a placeholder input that can be filled in later when the user provides the necessary waypoint names.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Please go for a shower.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
