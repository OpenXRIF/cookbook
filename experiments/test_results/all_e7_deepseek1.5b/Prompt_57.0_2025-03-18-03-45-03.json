    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding what the user is asking. They want to navigate from the starting location (0,0) to a specific waypoint named \"E7 silent study\". The available waypoint names are listed in a table with their descriptions and coordinates.\n\nNext, I'll compare the user's prompt against the known waypoints. Looking at the list, none of the provided waypoint entries mention an E7 or a silent study area. All the waypoints either have E (e.g., E1 Echo) or silent features but not specifically related to E7 or \"silent study\".\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that there's no waypoint named \"E7 silent study\" in the available list. This means the user's request doesn't match any known action.\n\nLooking back at the guidelines, if a function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, I should return an action with \"speak\" and the message indicating that the waypoint isn't found. In this case, the function being called is \"navigate\", which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, I should instruct the user to navigate to the E7 silent study location. But since I don't have specific coordinates for this area, I'll need to inform them that I can't provide exact instructions without additional data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7 silent study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
