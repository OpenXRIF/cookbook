For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to navigate from the Micwafes back to the E5 Entrance. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the system has a starting location at (0, 0) with no initial direction. So, I'll have to figure out where each waypoint is located based on their names and locations.\n\nLooking at the waypoints available, Micwafes are located at (1865, 434), E5 Entrance is at (180, 90). So, starting from (0,0), I need to get to (1865, 434) and then find the way back to (180, 90).\n\nBut how do I navigate through these waypoints? The system allows me to move in four directions: north, south, east, west. Maybe I can use the coordinate system to my advantage.\n\nFrom (0,0), moving north would increase the y-coordinate, while east increases the x. South decreases y, and west decreases x. So, to get from (0,0) to Micwafes at (1865, 434), I probably need to move east several times and then north a few times.\n\nWait, but what about navigating through other waypoints? Maybe the system has paths or routes between these waypoints that can be followed. So, perhaps there's a way to go from Micwafes to E5 Entrance by following specific paths.\n\nI also need to make sure not to pass any waypoint I'm not familiar with unless necessary. Since both Micwafes and E5 Entrance are known, maybe they don't pose any issues.\n\nSo, my strategy would be:\n1. Move east towards the x-axis until reaching Micwafes' x-coordinate.\n2. Then move north up along the y-axis to reachMicwafes' y-coordinate.\n3. From there, navigate back south and west using the coordinate system to get to E5 Entrance.\n\nI should also consider if any waypoint names interfere with this path, but since both are known, I can probably proceed smoothly.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code form:\n- Start at (0, 0).\n- Move east: x increases until reaching Micwafes' x of 1865.\n- Then move north: y increases to reach Micwafes' y of 434.\n- Now, navigate back south and west using the coordinate system.\n\nThis should get me from Micwafes to E5 Entrance. Once there, I can proceed with the commands as needed.\n</think>\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to navigating from the Micwafes (1865, 434) to the E5 Entrance (180, 90):\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Move East:** Increase your x-coordinate from 0 to 1865 by moving east.\n2. **Move North:** From Micwafes' y-coordinate of 434, increase y to reach 90.\n\n**Code Representation:**\n```javascript\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Micwafes Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 1865,\n                \"y\": 434\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 180,\n                \"y\": 90\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
