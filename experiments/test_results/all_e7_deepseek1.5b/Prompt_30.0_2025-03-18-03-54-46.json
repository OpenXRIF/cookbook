    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user with their prompt about querying waypoints and handling commands. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user's prompt says they want to know the number of entrances at E7 and then go to the C&D area. The example given uses \"navigate\" for the exits and then another command after waiting. \n\nI remember from the previous information that there are three known waypoint names: RoboHub, C&D - Coffee Area, and C&D - Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic. So, when processing this query, I need to check which of these waypoints are present.\n\nThe user's prompt mentions \"unknown zone,\" but looking at the available waypoints, it seems that E7 is not listed. From the structure provided earlier, each waypoint has a name and coordinates. Let me check if there's an entry for E7.\n\nIn the role section under Advanced Fuzzy Matching, I see that normalization includes converting to lowercase, extraneous tokens are removed, and tokenization. But I don't see any waypoint entries with \"E\" or \"C&.\" So it looks like E7 is unknown, meaning no known waypoint matches it.\n\nSo, for the first part of the prompt about querying exits at E7, since there's no matching waypoint, the function should just output an action saying \"speak\" and mention that it doesn't exist. \n\nThen, after checking the known waypoints, I need to navigate to RoboHub. From the example provided in the prompt, the user uses \"navigate\" with coordinates for RoboHub. So that's straightforward.\n\nPutting it together, the actions would be navigate to E7 first (but since there's no waypoint, we say it doesn't exist) and then navigate to RoboHub. \n\nI should also check if any functions are required beyond what's needed here. The user asked for navigating, speaking, and waiting, but since they can't speak about unknown zones, only navigate is used after confirming that E7 isn't a waypoint.\n\nSo the final output will be an action to \"navigate\" at RoboHub with its coordinates.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
