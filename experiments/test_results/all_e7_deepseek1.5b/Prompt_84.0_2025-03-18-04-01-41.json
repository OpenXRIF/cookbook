    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a detailed prompt about how to handle matching waypoints and executing commands with fuzzy logic. I need to figure out what actions the system should take when given that specific command.\n\nFirst, looking at the example queries and outputs, it seems the system can either speak or navigate based on the waypoint matches. But wait, the user's new command is \"Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes.\" So I need to process this as a complex command with multiple functions.\n\nThe command has two parts: navigating to C&D - Main Entrance and waiting for 10 minutes. Since both are actions beyond \"navigate,\" the output should include speak and wait. But before that, I need to check if there's an existing waypoint named C&D - Main Entrance. If not, the system must respond with an action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nIn this case, I should first normalize both inputs by converting them to lowercase. So \"C&D - Main Entrance\" becomes \"cand main entrance,\" and \"wait for 10 minutes\" becomes \"wait for 10 minutes.\" Then, remove any extraneous tokens. It seems none are there, so that's fine.\n\nNext, I'll split both into words: the input is [\"cand\", \"main\", \"entrance\"], and the waypoint name is [\"cand\", \"main\", \"entrance\"]. Now, check if each token in the waypoint matches the input tokens. Here, all match exactly. So it should be a match.\n\nBut wait, the system needs to handle multiple functions in a left-to-right sequence. Since both actions are present and no other waypoint is matched, I'll output speak with two actions: one for navigating and another for waiting.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Main Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Wait for 10 minutes\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
