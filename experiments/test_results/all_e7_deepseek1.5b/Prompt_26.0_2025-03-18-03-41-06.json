    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed prompt about matching waypoint names and handling commands with Fuzzy Matching. My task is to analyze the given example and then create an action plan for them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem fully. The user wants to navigate from the Microwaves to the E5 Enterance using waypoints that match the input. They also want to speak directly when they reach that point. But if there's no known waypoint, they should be told not to pick up anything.\n\nLooking at the example given, I see two waypoints: \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and \"RoboHub Entrance\". The user prompt includes commands like navigate, speak, wait, etc., but in their specific example, they're navigating towards a room. That makes sense because each waypoint has an associated room or location.\n\nSo, the first thing is to parse the input into tokens. I'll split both the user's query and each known waypoint name into individual words. Then, I need to check if all tokens of one waypoint are present in the user's query. If they are, that's a match.\n\nIn this example, the user's query starts at \"Microwaves\" and asks for navigation towards \"E5 Enterance\". The Microwaves is likely the waypoint name associated with a room or specific area. So, I need to check if \"Microwaves\" matches any known waypoint.\n\nI'll extract the lowercased versions of both inputs. For \"Microwaves\", the tokens are [\"microwave\"]. Each waypoint's names have their tokens as well. The Microwaves waypoint has tokens like [\"microwave\", \"C&D - Coffee Area\"], so none of these match \"microwave\". So, it doesn't find a matching waypoint.\n\nSince there's no known waypoint that matches this input, the output should be an action where the user speaks and says, \"invalid command: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\".\n\nI also need to consider how to handle complex commands. The example includes multiple actions in order of priority if necessary, but in this case, it's just one action since the query starts at a specific point.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I'll outline the steps for the function: normalize both inputs and waypoints, remove extraneous tokens, tokenize, check similarity, select or fall back to speak. Then, based on the normalized inputs matching any waypoint, execute the corresponding action.\n\nI should also note that if there are multiple ways a user can navigate (like via different waypoints), they should be checked in order of priority, but since the normalization and tokenization handle it, it's probably not necessary unless specified.\n\nFinally, I'll structure this into an action plan with clear outputs for both successful matches and unknown waypoint cases.\n</think>\n\nTo address your query, I will first parse the input and analyze the waypoints provided. The user is asking to navigate from \"Microwaves\" to \"E5 Enterance\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Parsing the Input**\n1. **Normalize:**\n   - Convert both inputs to lowercase.\n     - User's input: ` Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Enterance` \u2192 `\"microwave, can you guide me back to the e5 enterance\"`\n     - waypoint names: [\"Microwaves\", \"C&D - Coffee Area\"]\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:**\n   - Remove tokens that are likely building codes or non-essential.\n   - In this case, all tokens appear in order.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n   - Split both the normalized user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n     - User's input: `microwave, can you guide me back to the e5 enterance`\n       \u2192 [\"microwave\", \"can\", \"you\", \"guide\", \"me\", \"back\", \"to\", \"the\", \"e5\", \"enterance\"]\n     - waypoint names:\n       - Microwaveives: [\"microwave\", \"c&d - coffee area\"]\n       - E5 Enterance: [\"e5 enterance\"]\n\n---\n\n### **Similarity Calculation**\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n   - For each known waypoint, assess the match by checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n     - Microwaves:\n       - [\"microwave\", \"c&d - coffee area\"]\n       - User's input has \"microwave\" but does not have \"c&d - coffee area\".\n       - So, no match.\n\n   - E5 Enterance:\n     - Tokenization: [\"e5 enterance\"]\n     - User's input contains \"enterance\".\n     - So, this waypoint matches partially.\n\n---\n\n### **Selection and Fallback**\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n   - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n   - Since no waypoint fully matches the user's query, there is no action to take yet.\n\n6. **Output Action Plan:**\n   - Since there is no known waypoint that matches the input, the function will output:\n     ```plaintext\n     invalid command: 'microwave' is not a valid waypoint name.\n     ```\n     This means the user should speak and say, \"invalid command: 'microwave' is not a valid waypoint name.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Final Action**\nBased on the analysis above, here's the action plan:\n\n```plaintext\ninvalid command: 'microwave' is not a valid waypoint name.\n```\n\nThis action ensures that the user is informed when their query does not contain a matching waypoint.",
