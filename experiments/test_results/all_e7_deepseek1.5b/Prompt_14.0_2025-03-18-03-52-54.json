    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to process this user prompt. The user provided a detailed set of instructions and an example for advanced fuzzy matching when handling waypoint names. Now, their new prompt is about navigating between two specific waypoints without mentioning any functions or steps beyond what's allowed.\n\nFirst, let me break down the available waypoint information. I see there are multiple Waypoints like \"nroth Entrance,\" \"C and D areas,\" \"RoboHub Entrance,\" etc. Each has coordinates for navigation purposes. The user wants to go from \"nroth enterance\" to \"The Hub.\" \n\nI should check if both names match any known waypoint. Looking through the list, I see \"nroth Entrance\" but not \"nroth Enterance\"\u2014probably a typo. Then there's \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic,\" which might be where \"RoboHub\" is located.\n\nSo, the user wants to navigate from \"room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" to \"The Hub.\" I'll need to adjust the input to match known waypoint names and ensure all necessary coordinates are provided for navigation. The output should include a \"navigate\" action with the respective waypoints' details.\n</think>\n\nHere\u2019s the structured response based on the given prompt:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"nroth Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 0.0,\n        \"y\": 0.0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"The Hub\"\n        \"x\": 30,\n        \"y\": 60\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
