For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the available waypoints, there isn't one called \"E7 silent study.\" The known waypoints include places like the assembly room, shower B, shower A, and others. So, I'm thinking the first thing is to check if any of these relevant waypoints are related to E7 or a silent study.\n\nWait, E7 might be an abbreviation for something specific in this context. Maybe it's part of a code or a series of places that correspond to certain areas. I need to make sure I understand what each waypoint covers.\n\nThe user wants me to go \"take me to the E7 silent study.\" So, they probably want me to enter a specific place. Since there isn't a direct waypoint for E7, I might have to look at nearby waypoints or see if one of them is close enough.\n\nLooking back at the available waypoints, the assembly room has coordinates (1865, 434). If I'm navigating from the current location to the assembly room, that should cover any necessary steps. But since the prompt isn't about moving there but about taking me inside, maybe it's better to specify where the E7 silent study is.\n\nWait, perhaps \"E7\" is a specific identifier for the room or building within the system. I'm not sure, so maybe I can only respond by asking if it exists and suggest checking the known waypoints.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the goal is to match waypoint names from the user's input against the available list. So, even though \"E7 silent study\" isn't a listed waypoint, perhaps the relevant place is near E7.\n\nLooking again at the available waypoints:\n\n- Assembly Room: (1865, 434)\n- Shower B: (827, 610)\n- RoboHub Entrance: (25, 50)\n- E7 Silent Study: Wait, there isn't one, but maybe it's a specific room.\n\nSo, the user probably wants to go into a silent study. Since E7 is mentioned and no waypoint for that is listed, I might need to explain that if \"E7\" is an identifier for a specific place, then perhaps they can enter into that area.\n\nBut according to the rules, I should match waypoints from the user's input against known ones. If none are found, I have to respond by asking about the existence of such a waypoint.\n\nSo, the appropriate action would be to speak and ask if \"E7 silent study\" is a valid waypoint. That way, I can check if it exists before proceeding with any navigation or actions.\n\nI think that's the right approach. It ensures that the system doesn't attempt to navigate to an unknown place without verifying first.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Is 'E7 silent study' a known waypoint?
