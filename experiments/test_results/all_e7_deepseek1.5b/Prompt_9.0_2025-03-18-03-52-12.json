    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to generate actions based on the user prompt about going from the Assembly Room to the Ideas Clinic. The user provided some detailed guidelines for fuzzy matching and handling complex commands, but let me focus first on processing this specific request.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the available waypoint names and their descriptions. From the list given:\n\n- **Navigate**: \"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\"\n- **Speak**: \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n- **Wait**: 10 seconds\n\nThe task is to navigate from the current location (Assembly Room) to the Ideas Clinic. I don't have exact coordinates for these places, but perhaps it's implied that they are nearby or accessible.\n\nLooking at the normalization step, both the user input and each waypoint name need to be converted to lowercase. So \"We're\" becomes \"we\", which doesn't affect anything, but it helps with matching.\n\nNext, I'll consider if any tokens in the waypoint names contain letters and digits at the beginning. The navigation waypoint's description says you can navigate back to the Ideas Clinic from there, so \"ideas\" is a key term here. I don't see any other non-essential identifiers that could be removed. So, this should match correctly.\n\nSince the user wants to go from the current location (which is an unknown waypoint) to another known one, I need to check if my functions include navigation and wait. The user can choose actions in a left-to-right sequence unless specified otherwise. Here, navigate is first because it's a required function.\n\nI should also consider edge cases. Is there any waypoint that might not exist? No, the navigation is a known waypoint. So no need for error messages or fallbacks here.\n\nPutting it all together, the action should be \"navigate\" with the current location being unknown but implying access to Ideas Clinic.\n</think>\n\nTo handle the request, I first process the user prompt to normalize and extract relevant words: 'we're' becomes 'we', but this doesn't help. The waypoint is a navigation, which matches the requirement.\n\nI then check if any tokens in the known waypoints contain letters/digits at the beginning, ensuring none are removed. The navigate waypoint mentions 'ideas', which we need.\n\nSince I have navigation and wait functions, I choose to navigate as it's required and covers moving from the unknown location to Ideas Clinic. No error messages or fallbacks needed since everything is known and supported.\n\n**Actions:**\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"We're at the Assembly Room now.
