    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle the user prompt \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, understanding what the user is asking for. They want a way to navigate to an area called \"E7 silent study\" from the current location at (0, 0). So, I should look for any waypoint that represents the E7 silent study.\n\nLooking back at the provided waypoint definitions, I don't see a waypoint named \"E7 silent study.\" The closest is \"Shower A,\" which isn't relevant here. Since there's no known waypoint for the user's request, I need to consider how the system should respond when it can't find a matching waypoint.\n\nThe guidelines state that if a known waypoint doesn't exist, an action with \"speak\" and an error message is returned. So, in this case, the system will output {\"actions\": [{\"action\": \"speak\", \"input\": \"Unknown waypoint: E7 silent study\"}}].\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm following all the rules correctly. The user didn't mention any complex commands or ambiguities; it's a straightforward request for navigation. No ambiguity here, just a single command.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the response will be a speak action with an error message because there's no matching waypoint available.\n</think>\n\n{\"actions\": [{\"action\": \"speak\", \"input\": \"Unknown waypoint: E7 silent study\"}]}",
