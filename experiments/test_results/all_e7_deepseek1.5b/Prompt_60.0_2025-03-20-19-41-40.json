For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the prompt \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" based on the provided guidelines. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the available waypoints and their locations. The waypoint is \"E7 silent study,\" which probably stands for an E7 room with a silent study area. Looking back at the knowledge section, I don't see an entry named \"E7 silent study.\" However, there are entries like \"Assembly Room\" with coordinates (1865, 434) and \"Shower B\" with (827, 610). \n\nI notice that none of these waypoints directly mention a silent study. The closest might be the \"Assembly Room,\" which is typically a workspace for building operations. The shower room at E7 doesn't seem to be a waypoint listed here.\n\nNext, I'll check normalization by converting both the input prompt and each waypoint name to lowercase. That doesn't change much, so that's fine. Then, extraneous tokens\u2014looking for any tokens that start with letters and numbers but are not part of an identifier. The \"E7 silent study\" doesn't seem to have such tokens.\n\nTokenizing both inputs: the query is split into words like \"Take,\" \"me,\" to go, the E7 room, silent, study. For each waypoint, I'll check if all its tokens appear in the input. If not, I might add prefixes or remove them.\n\nLooking at \"Assembly Room\": it has \"Room\" and \"Assembly.\" The input doesn't have these words, so perhaps adding a prefix like \"To go to the E7 silent study.\" But that's speculative since there's no waypoint named \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nAnother thought: could \"E7 silent study\" be part of another word? Not really. So maybe it's not present.\n\nGiven that none of the waypoints match, I have to output an action with the message saying it doesn't exist. That should cover all cases where a known waypoint is not recognized.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'E7 silent study' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
