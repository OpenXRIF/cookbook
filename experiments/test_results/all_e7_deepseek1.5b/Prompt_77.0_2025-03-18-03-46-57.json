    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to process this user prompt and generate the appropriate actions. Let me start by breaking down what's being asked.\n\nFirst, the user wants a series of commands involving moving around different areas in C&D. The goal seems to be inspecting or cleaning specific locations before returning to the base station. \n\nLooking at the example provided, I see that each action is a separate command: navigate, speak, wait. So for each step in the prompt, we'll need a corresponding action.\n\nThe user prompt mentions several areas: C&D - Snack Area, Cold Drink Area, Pastry Area, Coffee Area, and Hot Food Area. Each of these needs to be navigated to. After visiting each area, I assume we need to speak to someone or possibly check for spills, but the example didn't show any spoken actions beyond confirming areas.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Navigate from base station (0,0) to C&D - Snack Area.\n2. Inspect for spills or trash at C&D - Snack Area.\n3. Proceed to C&D - Cold Drink Area and ensure all drinks are properly stockcaseded.\n4. Then visit C&D - Pastry Area to check expired products.\n5. After that, go to C&D - Coffee Area to confirm cleanliness.\n6. Finally, go to C&D - Hot Food Area for sanitization before returning.\n\nIn the actions list, each step would be a navigate command since the user is moving within the areas. The speak commands might not be necessary unless specific instructions require them, but in this case, I think just navigating would suffice.\n\nWait, the initial example had speak actions only when asking someone to hand something over or after receiving something. But here, it's about inspecting areas for spills and stockcasing drinks. So maybe no speak actions are needed because each step is purely navigational.\n\nTherefore, the actions list should consist of navigate commands for each specified area. No speak or wait actions unless specific instructions require it.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Snack Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\",\n        \"x\": 200,\n        \"y\": 150\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Pastry Area\",\n        \"x\": 150,\n        \"y\": 200\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 300\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\",\n        \"x\": 180,\n        \"y\": 250\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
