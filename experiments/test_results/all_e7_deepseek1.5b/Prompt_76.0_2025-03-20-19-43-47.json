For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to handle this command: \"Robot, begin security patrol at E5 Entrance and ensure no unauthorized access. Proceed to the Temporary Booth and check for any unattended items. Then, move to the Elevators and verify they are functioning properly. Head over to the Novelties section to monitor activity. Conclude your patrol at the East Entrance and report any unusual findings.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the command. It seems like a security protocol that involves several specific locations and tasks.\n\n1. **Robot**: The robot is initiating the patrol.\n2. **Begin security patrol**: This means the robot needs to be present at E5 Entrance. So, the entrance should have a robot activated or set up correctly.\n\n3. **Ensure no unauthorized access**: Before proceeding, the robot must check that there are no unauthorized people or devices in the area. The next step is to move to the Temporary Booth after ensuring this.\n\n4. **Proceed to the Temporary Booth**: Once checked for unauthorized access, the robot goes to E200 booth and checks for any unattended items. That means it needs access here as well.\n\n5. **Check elevators**: After reaching the booth, the robot then moves to the elevators section, like E300, to verify they're functioning properly.\n\n6. **Head over to Novelties section**: After verifying the elevators, the robot goes to the Novelties section, which might be E400, to monitor activity.\n\n7. **Conclude patrol at East Entrance**: Finally, it goes back to E5 Entrance and reports any unusual findings.\n\nNow, I need to see if these locations exist in the given waypoints. Let's check each location:\n\n- **E5 Entrance**: Yes, there's an E5 Entrance waypoint.\n- **E200 Temporary Booth**: There's a waypoint named E200, which likely refers to that location.\n- **E300 Elevators**: A waypoint for E300 is present.\n- **E400 Novelties Section**: I don't see a waypoint named E400. The closest is E1427, which might be the Ideas Clinic or another section. So, this location isn't covered by an existing waypoint.\n\nSince the robot needs to check the Novelties section and then conclude its patrol at East Entrance, but there's no waypoint for E400, I can't perform the last two tasks as specified. This means the patrol cannot be completed as per the given command because one of the required locations (Novelties Section) isn't recognized.\n\nTherefore, the actions would include a \"speak\" action acknowledging that the Novelties Section is not available, and perhaps inform the user about this in a fallback action.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"There is no waypoint for 'Novelties Section', so I cannot proceed to monitor activity here.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
