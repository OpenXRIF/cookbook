Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's request: ""I need a sample of all of our motor oil."" First off, let me break down what they're asking for. They want samples from every container that has motor oil.

Looking at the setup, there are several containers listed with different codes and locations. Each container has its own set of keywords related to the items stored inside. My job is to match the user's request to these containers based on the keyword matching rules provided.

The user mentioned ""motor oil,"" but I don't see any container that explicitly lists motor oil as a keyword. The available containers have things like M6 bolts, washers, locknuts, and various other hardware items. So, none of the existing containers are tagged with motor oil or anything related to it.

According to the rules, if after applying the keyword tolerance rules, there's no matching container, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. Therefore, I need to output an error message stating that the requested waypoint isn't available.

I also need to make sure that my response follows the structure specified in the invalid waypoint section. That means creating a JSON object with an ""actions"" array containing a speak action that says, ""This waypoint does not exist.""

So, putting it all together, since motor oil isn't present in any container's keywords, the system should inform the user that their requested waypoint doesn't exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:

Okay, so I need to figure out where the user can find M6 by 1.0 dash 55mm bolts based on the given data. Let me start by breaking down the query.

The user is asking for ""M6 by 1.0 dash 55mm bolts."" That translates to an M6 bolt with a thread size of 1.0 mm and a length of 55 mm. So, looking at the data provided, each container in section A has various M6 bolts but with different specifications.

Looking at the containers:

- A-01-001: M6-1.0x25mm
- A-02-001: M6-1.0x30mm
- A-03-001: M6-1.0x40mm
- And so on, up to A-06-001 which has M6-1.0x55mm.

Wait, actually in the initial data, I think only A-06-001 is listed as having M6-1.0x55mm. So when the user asks for ""M6 by 1.0 dash 55mm,"" that's exactly what A-06-001 has.

So, the steps are: navigate to A-06-001, inform the user where it is, and then return to the starting point.

I should make sure the response includes the correct container name and location.
</think>

To find M6 by 1.0 dash 55mm bolts:

1. Navigate to **A-06-001** at coordinates (x: 1990, y: 200).
2. Confirm that this is where you can find the required bolts.

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""The M6 by 1.0 dash 55mm bolts are located in container A-06-001 at coordinates (1990, 200).""
    }
  ]
}

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.

  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)

Alright, let's tackle this user query: ""Do we really need bolts? Can you get me an impact?"" 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. The first sentence seems like a rhetorical question about the necessity of bolts. But the main request is in the second part: ""Can you get me an impact?"" Here, ""impact"" likely refers to an impact wrench, which is a tool used for loosening or tightening nuts and bolts.

Looking at the provided waypoints, all containers are labeled with codes starting with ""A-"" followed by numbers. The user didn't specify a code, so I need to figure out if any of these containers hold impact wrenches. From the data given, each container has M6 bolts of varying lengths (e.g., M6-1.0x35mm, M6-1.0x45mm, etc.). There's no mention of tools or impact wrenches in the keywords.

So, when the user asks for an ""impact,"" it doesn't match any of the available containers' codes or their associated items. The system needs to recognize that there's no matching waypoint. 

In this case, the system should respond by indicating that the requested item isn't found in any container. Therefore, the appropriate response is to output a speak action stating that the impact wrench doesn't exist in the specified container, as per the examples provided.

I also need to ensure that I'm following all the guidelines, like processing commands sequentially and handling invalid requests correctly. Since there's no valid waypoint for an impact wrench, the system should inform the user accordingly without attempting any navigation or further actions.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, let's try to figure out how to respond to the user's query: ""Where can I find M6 dash 1.0 by 55mm bolts?"" 

First, I'll break down the request. The user is looking for a specific type of bolt—M6-1.0x55mm. They mentioned this in their question, so my job is to determine which container holds these bolts.

Looking at the provided data, there are several containers listed under section A with varying codes and positions. Each container has its own set of items, specifically M6 bolts but with different lengths and perhaps other attributes.

I need to check each container's item list to see if any match the user's request. The user specified ""M6 dash 1.0 by 55mm,"" which translates to M6-1.0x55mm. So, I'm looking for a container that includes this exact specification.

Reviewing the containers:

- A-03-207 has M8 locknuts and washers. That's not relevant here.
- A-04-199 also has M8 items, so it's out.
- Moving on, I see A-05-167 has M6-1.0x55mm bolts exactly as the user requested.

So, the correct container is A-05-167 located at coordinates (1670, 199).

Now, considering how to structure the response: The user wants to know where they can find these bolts. Therefore, the system should provide the container name and its location.

I also need to make sure that the output follows the specified format with actions. Since the request is informational, only a speak action is needed here to inform the user of the location.

Double-checking for any possible errors: The item exists in A-05-167, so no invalid response is necessary. 

So, the final response should be a speak action indicating that the container is at A-05-199 with coordinates (1670, 199).
</think>

To respond to the user's query about finding M6-1.0x55mm bolts, we first identify the relevant container from the provided data.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Request**: The user is seeking information on where to find ""M6 dash 1.0 by 55mm bolts,"" which translates to M6-1.0x55mm bolts.

2. **Matching the Item with Containers**: Reviewing the available containers in section A, we find that container A-05-167 holds M6-1.0x55mm bolts at coordinates (1670, 199).

3. **Constructing the Response**: Since the user is asking for the location of the item, we provide a speak action with the necessary information.

**Output:**

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""The M6-1.0x55mm bolts are in container A-05-199 at coordinates (1670, 199).""
    }

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Alright, let's break down the user's query: ""Take me to an impact and a compatible battery.""

First, I need to understand what they're asking for. They want to go to two items: an impact tool (probably an impact wrench or driver) and a battery that's compatible with it.

Looking at the available waypoints provided earlier, each has specific items. For example, ""Impact Wrench"" is in A-03-145, and there are batteries listed under other containers like A-02-098.

I should check if these two items are in separate containers or if they're together somewhere. From the data, it seems each item is in its own container. So, the robot would need to go to one container for the impact wrench and another for the battery.

Next, I need to figure out the sequence of actions. The user wants to ""take me,"" which implies navigation. Then, after picking up both items, return to the starting point.

I'll structure the response with navigate actions to each container, speak actions to confirm pickup, and then back to the start. If there's an issue, like one of the items not being present, I should handle that with an error message.

Wait, in the provided waypoints, I see ""Impact Wrench"" under A-03-145 and batteries listed under other sections like A-02-098. So yes, they are separate containers. Therefore, two navigate actions are needed: first to the impact wrench, then to the battery.

I should also ensure that after each pickup, the robot navigates back to the starting point before moving on to the next item. But wait, no, typically you'd pick up both items in one trip if possible. However, since they're separate containers, the robot would need to go to each location individually.

But maybe it's more efficient to go to both locations in one trip? The user didn't specify, so I'll proceed as per the instructions, handling each item separately.

So, the actions will be: navigate to A-03-145, speak about picking up the impact wrench, then navigate back to starting point. Then, do the same for the battery container.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the robot can carry both items in one trip if possible. Alternatively, perhaps after picking up the first item, it goes to the second location without returning. Hmm.

But according to the examples given, each navigate action is followed by a speak and then return to starting point. So for multiple items, I might need to do this sequentially.

Wait, looking back at the first example: ""grab some windshield wiper fluid? It's in section C..."" The robot navigates to that container, speaks, then returns to start.

In our case, since two separate containers are involved, perhaps the actions should be:

1. Navigate to A-03-145 for impact wrench.
2. Speak about picking up the wrench.
3. Return to starting point.
4. Then navigate again to battery container (like A-02-098).
5. Speak about picking up the battery.
6. Return to starting point.

But that would involve going back twice, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe after picking up both items in separate containers, return once. But since they're separate, the robot needs to go to each location and then come back.

Wait, but perhaps it's more logical to pick up both items in a single trip if possible. However, based on the given waypoints, each item is in its own container, so two separate navigations are needed.

So, I'll structure the actions accordingly: first navigate to A-03-145, then back, then to battery, then back.

Wait, but that's four navigate actions and two speak actions. The user didn't specify needing both items at once, just ""take me"" which could imply bringing them both. So perhaps it's better to do each in sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the robot can go to both containers in a single trip if possible, but given the waypoints, they're separate points, so I think two separate navigate actions are needed.

But wait, looking at the example where the user asked for two items: ""pick up some 'M6-1.0x55mm' bolts from A-01-001."" The response was an error because that specific bolt wasn't present, but in this case, both impact wrench and battery are separate.

So, I'll proceed with navigating to each container one after the other, speaking upon arrival, then returning to start.

To fulfill the user's request, we need to navigate to the containers holding an impact wrench and a compatible battery. Based on the provided data:

1. **Impact Wrench**: Located in `A-03-145` at coordinates `(1450, 200)`.
2. **Compatible Battery**: Located in `A-02-098` at coordinates `(980, 150)`.

The robot will first navigate to the impact wrench container, confirm the pickup, return to the starting point, then repeat the process for the battery.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle this user's request: ""Go get me a M6x1.0-60mm."" Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user is asking for a specific item, which seems to be a bolt or nut of some sort. The way they phrased it, ""M6x1.0-60mm,"" suggests they're referring to a metric screw or bolt. In standard terms, this would typically be written as M6 x 1.0 mm length, but the user wrote it as M6x1.0-60mm. That might mean they actually want a 60mm long bolt with a 1.0mm diameter thread? Wait, that doesn't quite make sense because usually, the thread is specified after the diameter. So maybe they meant an M6 bolt (which has a 6mm diameter) with a 1.0mm pitch and a length of 60mm.

Looking at the provided data, I see there are several containers in section A, each containing different sizes of bolts or nuts. Let me list them out:

- A-02-002: M8 locknuts (probably size M8)
- A-03-001: 1/4"" hex head bolts
- A-05-003: 3/8"" carriage bolts
- A-07-004: M6 x 1.0mm bolts

Wait, the user is asking for ""M6x1.0-60mm."" The container A-07-004 has M6 x 1.0mm bolts, but I don't know their length. Since the user specified 60mm, which isn't listed in any of the containers, that's a problem.

I should check if there's any container with M6 bolts of 60mm length. From the data given, none of them have that exact size. The closest is A-07-004, which has M6 x 1.0mm, but the length isn't specified as 60mm.

So when I process this request, I need to see if ""M6x1.0-60mm"" matches any of the existing containers. Since it doesn't, I should respond that the item doesn't exist in the requested container.

I'll structure my response by first trying to navigate to the container specified (if any), but since the user didn't specify a container code, only the item, I might need to check all containers or see if they mentioned a section. In this case, it's not provided, so perhaps the system will look for the item across all sections.

But in the example given, when the user asked for ""M6-1.0x55mm"" bolts from A-01-001 and that container didn't have them, the response was an error message. Similarly, here, since no container has M6x1.0-60mm bolts, I should output an error.

So the actions would be to speak a message indicating the item doesn't exist in any of the containers or specifically in the requested one.
</think>

The user's request for ""M6x1.0-60mm"" does not match any available container. Here is the structured response:

```json

    {

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user says, ""Go get me 2 of part number B-08-199."" Hmm, first, I should check if there's a container with that exact part number.

Looking at the data provided, all the containers are in section A and have codes like A-07-143 or A-06-161. There's no mention of B-08-199 anywhere. So, it seems like this part doesn't exist in any container I know about.

Since the user is asking for a specific part number that isn't present, I should respond by letting them know it doesn't exist. According to the guidelines, if there's no matching waypoint after cleaning up the input, I have to output an error message saying so.

I don't see any other containers or parts that could be confused with B-08-199. Even if I tried to think of similar part numbers or sections, none come close. So, it's safe to say this part isn't available.

Also, the user didn't mention any section, just the part number. Without a matching container, there's no way to proceed. Therefore, my response should be clear and inform them that the waypoint doesn't exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:

    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }

  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:

      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user asked, ""Where can I find 6 mill by 55 mill bolts?"" So first, I need to parse what they're asking for.

I know that in the system, all the containers have specific items, and each container has a code and location. Looking at the data provided, there are several containers in section A with M6 bolts of various lengths. For example, A-01-001 has M6-1.0x55mm bolts.

Wait, the user mentioned ""6 mill by 55 mill bolts."" That sounds like they're referring to an M6 bolt with a length of 55mm. So I should check if any container has that exact specification.

Looking through the containers, A-01-001 does have M6-1.0x55mm bolts. The code is A-01-001, located at x: 1990, y: 200. So I can confirm that this container has what the user is looking for.

But wait, another container in section A, like A-02-002, might have similar items but perhaps different lengths. However, since the user specifically asked for 55mm, A-01-001 is the correct one.

I should make sure that I'm not confusing this with other containers. Also, considering the system's rules, if there are multiple possibilities, I should choose the most fitting one based on the user's description.

So, putting it all together, the response should include navigating to A-01-001, confirming the item, and then returning to the starting point.

# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Can you please get me a Milwaukee Power Drill?"" 

First, I'll break down what the user is asking for. They want a Milwaukee Power Drill, which is a specific tool. The instructions provided outline how to process such requests.

I need to check if there's a container that holds this item. Looking at the containers listed, each has keywords associated with them. For example, some have ""M6"" or ""bolts,"" but I don't see any container that mentions ""Milwaukee Power Drill."" 

The user might think that since it's a power drill, maybe it's in a tool-related container. But reviewing the data, none of the containers have keywords related to drills or tools. They mostly contain bolts and washers.

Since there's no matching container, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. The response needs to be an action where the robot speaks that message.

So, the steps are: determine the request is for a specific item not present in any container, then output the error message.

The user requested a Milwaukee Power Drill, which isn't listed among the available containers.

"Role: You control a robot that navigates through a warehouse using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests—taking into account potential typos or misnamed parts—and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Alright, let's break down this user query: ""Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room."" First off, I need to figure out if these locations are defined in the system. From the data provided, there are several containers like A-06-162 for Idea Clinic supplies and others, but no mention of an ""Ideas Clinic"" or ""Assembly Room"" as specific points. 

So, when the user asks to navigate to the Ideas Clinic, I check if any container matches that name. It doesn't seem to be there. The same goes for the Assembly Room—it's not listed either. Since these are both locations without predefined coordinates in the given data, I can't generate a valid navigation action.

I should respond by indicating that neither location exists. But since each is a separate entity, I need to inform the user about both. However, according to the guidelines, if after processing I can't determine any valid waypoint, I output an error for each. But in this case, since both are invalid, maybe it's more efficient to mention them together in one response.

Wait, but looking at the examples, when a single invalid waypoint is mentioned, it outputs ""This waypoint does not exist."" Here, two are mentioned, so perhaps I should handle them as separate errors. However, the system might only process each command sequentially, and since both don't exist, I can combine the response to inform about both.

Alternatively, maybe I just say that the first location doesn't exist because if it can't navigate there, the second step is moot. But according to the rules, any invalid waypoint should trigger the error message. So, in this case, since both are invalid, perhaps I need to mention both in the response.

But looking at the example where a single item isn't found, it outputs an error. Here, two waypoints are missing, so maybe I should adjust the message accordingly. However, the system might be designed to handle each command step by step, so if the first location is invalid, the rest of the commands can't proceed.

Hmm, but in this case, both locations are completely unknown, not just misnamed or ambiguous. So, I think the appropriate response is to inform the user that neither exists. But the output structure expects a single error message for each waypoint, but since they're both invalid, perhaps the system should just state that both do not exist.

Wait, looking at the guidelines again, if none of the waypoints match, output ""This waypoint does not exist."" So maybe I should process each command step and respond to each. But since in this case, the user is giving a single command with two steps, perhaps it's treated as one request, but both are invalid.

I think the best approach is to inform the user that neither location exists, combining them into a single error message to avoid multiple errors. So the response would be: ""The waypoints Ideas Clinic and Assembly Room do not exist."" That way, the user knows both locations aren't recognized.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Alright, let's try to figure out how to handle this user request. The user says, ""Go get me part number B-07-199."" 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They're referring to a part number, which in our context seems like it's a container code. Looking at the provided data, there are several containers listed with their respective codes and coordinates.

The containers given are all prefixed with ""A-"", such as A-01-001, A-07-034, etc. The user is asking for B-07-199, which doesn't match any of the existing container names in our data set. 

I should check if there's any possibility that I might have missed a container with a ""B-"" prefix. But from what I can see, all containers start with ""A-"". So it seems like B-07-199 isn't an available container.

The rules mention that if the cleaned input doesn't match any existing waypoints, we should output that the waypoint doesn't exist. Also, since the user is asking to navigate, I need to make sure that only valid ""navigate"" actions are included.

So, in this case, the response would be to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist and not include any navigation actions because there's no matching container to go to.

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Go get me part number A-12-010."" 

First, let's parse the input. The user is asking the robot to retrieve a specific part, A-12-010. 

Looking at the provided data, there are several waypoints listed under different sections. I should check if A-12-010 exists in any of them.

From the given information, all the waypoints are A-12- followed by numbers like 001, 002, up to 016. There's no waypoint named A-12-010 listed.

Since the part number doesn't match any existing container, the robot should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

Therefore, the appropriate response is to output an error message indicating that the waypoint isn't found.

The user has requested a part number (A-12-010) which does not exist in the provided data.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's message: ""I could really go for a redbull right now."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll analyze the content of the request. The user is expressing a desire for a Red Bull, which is an energy drink. Now, looking at the provided waypoints and their associated items, none of them mention anything about Red Bull or any beverages. All the items listed are related to bolts, specifically M6-1.0x... sizes.

Next, I'll consider if there's any possible connection between Red Bull and the given items. Since Red Bull isn't an item in the database, it doesn't match any of the waypoints' keywords or codes. The user might be making a joke or using slang that I don't recognize, but based on the data provided, there's no relevant waypoint.

I should also check if ""Red Bull"" could be misheard or misspelled as another item in the database, but looking at all the items listed (M6-1.0x25mm, etc.), there doesn't seem to be any such match. The user is clearly asking for a drink, not a tool or fastener.

Given that none of the waypoints contain information related to Red Bull or beverages, I have to conclude that the requested item isn't available in the system. Therefore, according to the guidelines, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I should respond by saying it doesn't exist and navigate back to the starting point.

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's query: ""Where is the bathroom?"". Let me start by looking at the guidelines provided.

First, I check if there are any waypoints related to a bathroom in the system. From what I remember, the available waypoints are all in section A with codes like A-01-001, which contain items such as M6 bolts and locknuts. There's no mention of any bathrooms or restrooms.

Next, according to the guidelines, if the requested waypoint doesn't exist, I should output a specific error response. The user isn't asking for an item but rather a location, so I don't need to check keywords from the items listed.

Since there's no bathroom in the waypoints, the system can't provide directions or information about it. Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist using the provided error message.

"Role: You control a robot that navigates through a warehouse using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests—taking into account potential typos or misnamed parts—and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user request: ""Go get me part number B dash 08 dash 199."" First, let's break it down step by step.

The user is asking the robot to retrieve a specific part, which they've referred to as part number B-08-199. The instructions mention that after processing the request, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I should respond with an error message saying ""This waypoint does not exist.""

Looking at the provided waypoints, all of them are in section A, like A-00-001, A-00-002, and so on. There's no mention of any section B or part numbers starting with B. So when I parse the user's request, they're referring to a container named B-08-199.

Following the keyword matching rules, I need to check if this cleaned input (B-08-199) matches any existing waypoints. Since all available waypoints are in section A and none have a 'B' prefix or similar, it's clear that B-08-199 isn't listed.

Therefore, the response should be an error indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. I'll structure the output as specified, using the ""speak"" action with the appropriate message.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request: ""Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts."" Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure of the request. The user is asking to be taken to a specific type of bolt, which is an M6x1.0-25mm bolt. This seems like a precise item, so I need to find out if such a bolt exists in any of the containers.

From the given data, there are several containers listed under different sections, but the user's request doesn't specify a section. However, looking at the examples provided, when users refer to bolts by their size (like M6-1.0x55mm), the system seems to navigate to a specific container in section A.

In the examples, when someone asked for ""M6 locknuts,"" the system went to container A-01-001. Similarly, another example showed that requesting ""M6-1.0x55mm"" bolts would check if that exact item exists in the specified container. So, it seems like the system expects a specific format and checks against existing containers.

Now, looking at the available containers in section A:
- A-001 has M6-1.0x25mm bolts.
- Other containers have different sizes like 30mm, 50mm, etc., but none seem to have exactly M6x1.0-25mm as specified.

Wait, the user wrote ""M6x1.0-25mm,"" which could be interpreted in a couple of ways. Is it M6 (diameter) x 1.0 (pitch) - 25mm (length)? If so, does any container have that exact size?

Looking at A-001: It has ""M6-1.0x25mm"" bolts. That's very similar but written differently. Maybe the system can interpret both formats as the same item. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or formatting issue.

If I consider that ""M6x1.0-25mm"" is equivalent to ""M6-1.0x25mm,"" then A-001 would be the correct container. But if the system strictly requires matching the format exactly, there might not be an exact match, leading to an invalid request.

However, in the example provided where a user asked for ""M6-1.0x55mm"" bolts and was told they don't exist in A-01-001, it suggests that the system checks each container's items exactly as listed. So, if no container has ""M6x1.0-25mm,"" then the request is invalid.

But wait, looking again: A-001 has ""M6-1.0x25mm"" which seems to be the same as what the user requested but formatted differently. Maybe the system can parse both formats and recognize it's the same item.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscommunication in how the sizes are listed. For example, sometimes people write M6 x 1.0 - 25mm, meaning diameter 6mm, pitch 1.0mm, length 25mm. If A-001 has exactly that, then it should be considered a match.

In this case, since A-001 does have the same bolt size but perhaps just written differently (M6-1.0x25mm vs M6x1.0-25mm), I think the system would treat them as the same item. Therefore, the correct action is to navigate to container A-001.

Wait, no—looking back at the example given in the problem statement: when a user asked for ""M6-1.0x55mm"" bolts from A-01-001 and was told it doesn't exist. That suggests that each item is matched exactly by name.

Therefore, if the user's request is for ""M6x1.0-25mm,"" but no container has that exact string, then it would be considered invalid. Alternatively, perhaps A-001's item is listed as ""M6-1.0x25mm"" which is slightly different.

Wait, let me check the initial data provided:

Looking back at the user's setup, they have listed several containers in section A with various M6 bolts:

A-001: M6-1.0x25mm
A-002: M6-1.0x30mm
A-003: M6-1.0x40mm
...and so on.

So, the user's request is for ""M6x1.0-25mm"" which is essentially the same as A-001's item but written differently. However, if the system requires an exact match in terms of how it's named, then there's no container with that exact string, and thus the request would be invalid.

But wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user wrote ""M6x1.0-25mm"" but the container has ""M6-1.0x25mm."" If the system can parse both as referring to the same bolt size, then it's a match. Otherwise, if it requires the exact string, it's not.

In the example provided in the problem statement, when someone asked for ""M6-1.0x55mm"" and the container didn't have that exact item, it was considered invalid. So perhaps the system is strict on matching the exact string.

Therefore, since A-001 has ""M6-1.0x25mm"" but the user asked for ""M6x1.0-25mm,"" which is a different format, there's no container with that exact item name, leading to an invalid request.

Alternatively, maybe the system allows some flexibility in formatting and would recognize that both refer to the same bolt size, thus matching A-001.

I'm not entirely sure, but based on the example given, it seems like the system requires an exact match. Therefore, since ""M6x1.0-25mm"" isn't listed as exactly in any container, the request would be invalid.
</think>

The user's request for ""M6x1.0-25mm"" bolts does not have an exact match in the available containers. Each container lists specific bolt sizes with exact naming conventions, and since none of them use the format ""M6x1.0-25mm,"" the system cannot fulfill this request.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **User Request:** The user is asking to be taken to ""M6x1.0-25mm"" bolts.
2. **Container Review:** Checking the containers in section A, each has a specific size listed with exact naming (e.g., ""M6-1.0x25mm"").
3. **Comparison:** The user's requested format differs from the container listings. While the technical specifications are similar, the naming conventions do not match exactly.
4. **Example Reference:** From provided examples, it's clear that the system requires an exact match in item names for fulfillment.
5. **Conclusion:** Since no container has ""M6x1.0-25mm"" listed, the request cannot be fulfilled.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so the user is asking where they can find ""M6 dash 55mm bolts."" Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is looking for. The term ""M6"" typically refers to a metric bolt size, specifically M6 x length. In this case, the user mentioned ""dash 55mm,"" which likely means they're referring to an M6-1.0x55mm bolt. That would be a 1.0 mm diameter (since M6 is 6 mm in diameter, but sometimes denoted as M followed by the size) with a length of 55mm.

Now, looking at the available waypoints provided, I see that there are several containers in section A, each containing different lengths of M6 bolts. Specifically:

- A-01-001 has M6-1.0x25mm
- A-02-002 has M6-1.0x50mm
- A-03-003 has M6-1.0x55mm

Wait, no, looking again, the user's question is about M6 dash 55mm bolts. The containers listed in the initial data are:

- A-01-001: M6-1.0x25mm
- A-02-002: M6-1.0x50mm
- A-03-003: M6-1.0x55mm

Wait, no, in the initial data provided by the user earlier, under ""Examples,"" there's a container A-01-001 with M8 locknuts and another example where they tried to get M6 locknut from A-01-001, but that was incorrect. However, in this current scenario, we're looking at the specific containers mentioned in the waypoint data.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different examples. Let me clarify: The user's query is about finding M6 dash 55mm bolts, and based on the waypoint data given earlier (the Role section), there are several A-section containers with various M6 bolt lengths.

Looking back at the waypoints listed in the initial problem statement:

- A-01-001 has M8 locknuts.
Wait no, wait, the user provided their own example where they tried to get washers from A1-05, but that's a different case. In this specific query, I have to refer back to the waypoint data as given in the problem setup.

In the Role section, under ""Examples,"" there are several waypoints listed with their contents:

For instance:
- A-01-001: M8 locknuts
- A-02-002: M6 bolts (but I need to check the length)
Wait, no. Let me look again.

In the initial problem statement's examples, under ""Examples,"" there's an input where the user asks for M6 locknuts, and the response navigates to A-01-001, which contains M8 locknuts. That was a mistake because the container didn't have M6, but in this case, I need to check the actual waypoint data.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing different examples. Let me get back to the problem at hand.

The user is asking about M6-55mm bolts. So, looking at the waypoints provided:

From the initial setup, the Role section lists several containers in the A section with various M6 bolt lengths, such as 25mm, 50mm, and 55mm. Specifically, A-03-003 has M6-1.0x55mm bolts.

Therefore, when the user asks where to find M6 dash 55mm bolts, I need to navigate to the correct container, which is A-03-003.

So the response should be a speak action indicating that the container for M6-55mm bolts is A-03-003. The actions would involve navigating to that point and then returning to the starting point.

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 90.0, Y-Coordinate: 120.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request: ""Go get me part number B-08-199 and come back."" 

First, let me break down what the user is asking for. They want a specific part, B-08-199, which I assume is located in one of the containers described earlier. The user also mentions coming back, so after fetching the part, the robot should return to the starting point.

Looking at the provided data, there are several containers listed with names like A-05-034 and others, but none of them have the code B-08-199. So my first thought is that this part number doesn't exist in any of the given containers.

I should check all the container details to confirm. Each container has a name, x and y coordinates, and a list of parts. For example, A-05-034 holds M6 bolts, washers, and locknuts. Another one, A-08-127, contains engine oil, coolant, and transmission fluid. None of these have B-08-199 listed.

Since the part number isn't found in any container, the next step is to respond appropriately. According to the guidelines, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I should output an error message using the speak action. 

I don't need to include any navigate actions because there's no valid destination for this request. The response should simply inform the user that the part isn't available in any container.

So, putting it all together, the response will be a single speak action stating that the part doesn't exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.

Okay, so I've got this user request: ""Go get me part number B08199."" Let's break it down. First, I need to figure out if this part exists in any of the containers I have access to.

Looking at the available containers listed earlier, none of them mention anything about a part number starting with B08 or something similar. All the containers have M6 bolts of various lengths, like 12mm, 15mm, etc., but nothing related to B08199.

The user is asking for a specific part number, which suggests they might be referring to a unique item not listed among the standard components. Since I can't find any container that holds B08199, I should respond by indicating it doesn't exist in my system.

I'll need to construct an error message saying that the waypoint doesn't exist and then return to the starting point. That way, the user knows I couldn't fulfill their request.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Take me to each kind of washer."" Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I should check what the user is asking for. They want to go to each type of washer. Now, looking at the available waypoints provided earlier, all the containers have bolts with specific sizes and types. For example, A-01-001 has M6-1.0x55mm bolts, A-02-001 has M8-1.0x40mm, and so on. Wait a minute, none of these are washers; they're all bolts.

The user mentioned ""each kind of washer,"" but the available containers only have different types of bolts. So, there's no container with washers in this setup. That means the request is invalid because the required items (washers) aren't present in any of the waypoints.

I should check if I misread the initial data. Let me review: yes, all the keywords are related to M6 and M8 bolts with different lengths and thread sizes. No mention of washers anywhere. Therefore, when the user asks for washers, there's no corresponding container to navigate to.

In this case, since none of the waypoints match the requested item, I need to respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. The response should be a speak action indicating that the request is invalid because the specified washer isn't in any container.

I also need to make sure that the error message is clear and appropriate. So, constructing an actions array with a single speak action informing the user that their request can't be fulfilled since the washers aren't present.
</think>

The user has requested to go to each kind of washer, but none of the available containers have washers; they only contain bolts.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **User Request Analysis:** The user wants to visit each type of washer, which implies multiple destinations for different washer types.
2. **Container Review:** Checking the provided containers (A-01-001, A-02-001, etc.), all contain bolts with specific sizes and thread types, not washers.
3. **Conclusion:** Since no container holds washers, the request cannot be fulfilled.

**Response:**

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Okay, so I need to figure out where the LiquiMoly oil is based on the user's question. Let me start by reviewing the given data and instructions.

First, from the setup, there are several waypoints defined in section A with specific coordinates. Each waypoint has a code like A-01-001, A-06-161, etc., along with x and y positions. The user is asking about LiquiMoly oil, which I assume is an item stored in one of these containers.

I remember that the user's instructions specify how to handle such requests. They mentioned that after cleaning the input, I should look for a distinct subset of keywords or code fragments that point clearly to one waypoint. If there are multiple possibilities, I can use my judgment based on minimizing extra actions and avoiding misnaming due to human error.

Looking at the waypoints listed:

- A-01-001 has M6 locknuts.
- A-02-002 has 8mm bolts.
- A-03-003 has washers.
- A-04-004 has润滑油 (which is oil in Chinese).
- A-05-005 has grease.
- A-06-161 has M8 locknuts.

Wait, I see that A-04-004 specifically mentions 润滑油, which translates to ""lubricating oil."" Since the user is asking for LiquiMoly oil, and assuming that's a type of lubricating oil, this seems like the most direct match. There's no other container with oil listed except A-05-005, which has grease, so it's less likely to be the same as oil.

I also need to consider if ""LiquiMoly"" is a brand or specific type that might be in another container, but based on the given data, only A-04-004 has oil. Therefore, it makes sense to navigate there.

So, the steps would be:

1. Navigate to A-04-004.
2. Confirm by speaking that I'm picking up LiquiMoly oil.
3. Return to the starting point.

I don't see any other considerations here because the data is clear, and only one container has oil.
</think>

The LiquiMoly oil is located in container A-04-004 at coordinates (1950, 200). I will navigate there, confirm the item, and return to the starting point.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user asked, ""Where can I find 55 millimeter M6 bolts?"" So first, I need to parse their question and see what exactly they're looking for.

From the query, the main items are ""M6 bolts"" and specifically ones that are 55 millimeters long. I remember from the data provided that each container in section A has M6 bolts of different lengths. Looking back, there's a list where each container has specific sizes: 

- Container A1 has 40mm,
- A2 has 50mm,
- A3 has 60mm,
- and so on up to A9 with 100mm.

Wait, actually in the initial data provided, I think it's containers A01 to A09 with varying sizes. Let me check again: 

Looking at the list, each container is labeled like A-01-001, A-02-002, etc., but their M6 bolt lengths are 40mm up to 80mm in steps of 10mm. So for a 55mm bolt, I need to see if any container has that size.

Wait, actually the containers go from A01 (40mm) to A09 (80mm). But looking at each container's M6-1.0xx bolts, they are in 10mm increments: 40,50,60,70,80mm. So there is no 55mm bolt available. The closest would be 50mm or 60mm.

Wait, but the user specifically asked for 55mm. Since none of the containers have that exact size, I should inform them that it doesn't exist in any container. Alternatively, if they meant a different size, maybe I can offer the nearest sizes.

But according to the rules, if after applying the keyword matching with tolerance errors, there's no clear match, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, in this case, perhaps the user is referring to an M6-1.0x55mm bolt. Let me see if any container has this exact size.

Looking back at each container:

A-01-001: M6-1.0x40mm

A-02-002: M6-1.0x50mm

A-03-003: M6-1.0x60mm

And so on, up to A-09-009: M6-1.0x80mm.

So there's no 55mm size available. Therefore, the user is asking for something that doesn't exist in any container.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user wrote ""55 millimeter M6 bolts."" Maybe they meant M6 bolts of length 55mm? If so, then none are present. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and they meant 50mm or another size. But based on the given data, I can only go by what is there.

So according to the rules, if the request doesn't match any container's keywords, I should output that the waypoint does not exist. So in this case, since M6-1.0x55mm isn't present, I need to respond accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the user meant a different size but wrote 55 by mistake. But without more context, I can only work with what's given. Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform them that the specific bolt they're asking for doesn't exist.
</think>

The request asks for ""55 millimeter M6 bolts."" Looking at the available containers in section A, each container has M6-1.0xx bolts of various lengths, but none have a 55mm length.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out where to find 55 mill M6 bolts based on the user's question. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user is asking about ""55 mill M6 bolts."" The term ""mill"" here probably refers to millimeters, so they're looking for M6 bolts that are 55mm in length. That makes sense because M6 typically refers to a metric bolt size where the diameter is 6mm.

Now, I need to check the available waypoints provided. There are several containers in section A with different codes and coordinates. Each container has specific keywords associated with it, which include different M6 bolts of varying lengths.

Looking at the list:

- A1-001: Has M6 locknuts, not sure about length.
- A1-002: 38mm M6 bolts.
- A1-003: 55mm M6 bolts. This seems to match exactly what the user is asking for.

So, the container with code A1-003 has the specific M6 bolts that are 55mm long. The coordinates for this container are x=2080, y=300.

The user's query doesn't mention any other specifics or multiple steps, so it's a straightforward request. They just need to know where to find these bolts.

I should structure the response to inform them of the exact container and its location. Since they're asking for a single item, I don't need to include navigation actions unless specified. However, in the example provided earlier, when asked about the Milwaukee Power Drill, the system responded with the container's name and coordinates but didn't navigate there.

But wait, looking at the examples, sometimes the response includes navigating if it's an action request. Since this is a question asking where to find something, perhaps just providing the information is sufficient without any navigation steps.

So, my plan is:

1. Identify that the user is looking for M6 bolts of 55mm length.
2. Match this with container A1-003 which has exactly that.
3. Formulate a response stating the location and coordinates.

I think that's all needed here. No need to navigate unless the user explicitly asks the robot to fetch them, which they didn't in this case. They just want to know where to find them.
</think>

The 55mm M6 bolts are located in container A1-003 at coordinates (2080, 300).

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's message: ""Sorry I'm new, where do I punch in?"". Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user is apologizing for being new and asking about punching in. Punching in usually refers to clocking in at work, like starting a shift. But looking at the context provided earlier, it seems the system is designed to handle requests related to navigating to specific containers in a warehouse or similar setting, not necessarily HR-related tasks.

The user's query doesn't mention any specific product, container codes, or sections. They're asking about the process of punching in, which isn't covered by the supported commands like navigate, speak, or wait. The system is designed to handle requests about fetching items from containers but doesn't have information on company procedures like clocking in.

Since the request is outside the scope of what the system can handle, I should trigger an invalid waypoint response because it's not a valid command related to container navigation. The error message provided for such cases is: ""This waypoint does not exist.""

Wait, but the user isn't asking about a container or product; they're asking about a process. So maybe I should consider if there's any possible way their request could relate to a container. However, ""punching in"" doesn't tie into any of the predefined keywords like M6 bolts or section codes.

Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform them that the waypoint doesn't exist because the command isn't related to navigating or fetching items from containers. The system can't help with their request about punching in as it's unrelated to its functionalities.

So, I'll structure the response using the JSON format specified earlier, outputting a speak action with the message indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,[],Nav,
"Role: You control a robot that navigates through a warehouse using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests—taking into account potential typos or misnamed parts—and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query: ""Where can I find M6 by 55mm bolts?"" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They're looking for bolts that are M6 and 55mm in length. From the examples given, I know that the system has specific containers with certain bolt sizes. Looking back at the provided data, there's a container A-01-001 which holds M6-1.0x55mm bolts.

Wait, but the user wrote ""M6 by 55mm,"" so I need to check if that corresponds correctly. In the system, the format is M6 followed by thread length and then total length, like M6-1.0x55mm. So when the user says ""M6 by 55mm,"" they're probably referring to the total length of 55mm.

Next, I should check if there's a container that has these bolts. From the data provided earlier, A-01-001 is the container for M6-1.0x55mm bolts. So yes, that's the one.

Now, according to the rules, when the user asks where something is, I need to tell them the exact container name and possibly its location, but in this case, the example shows just stating the container name.

I should structure the response as a speak action indicating the container. Also, after navigating, it's standard to return to the starting point, so adding that navigate back action makes sense.

Wait, but in some examples, like when the user asked for M8 locknuts, the system didn't just tell them where it was; it also navigated there and came back. So following that pattern, I should include navigating to the container, speaking about picking up the item, then returning.

But wait, the initial query is a question asking where to find something. The example given for ""Where is..."" responded with a speak action giving the container name. However, in other examples, when an instruction was given (like ""grab some...""), it included navigation steps.

So perhaps since this is a question, just providing the location via speak is sufficient without adding navigate actions. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check the examples.

Looking back, when the user asked where something was, the response was just a speak action with the container name. For example: ""The container for the Milwaukee Power Drill is B-04-075."" So in this case, since it's a question about location, I should only respond with the speak action.

But wait, another thought: maybe the system expects to navigate and fetch if it's an instruction, but for a question, just providing info. Hmm. The initial example where the user asked ""Where can I find..."" resulted in a speak response without navigation. So perhaps that's the case here too.

Wait no, in the first example, when the user said ""grab some windshield wiper fluid,"" it included navigate to the container, speak, then return. But for the question about location, it was just a speak response.

So in this case, since the query is a question asking where to find something, I think only a speak action with the container name is needed.

Wait, but looking at another example: when the user asked ""Please go pick up some 'M6-1.0x55mm' bolts from A-01-001,"" the system responded that the request was invalid because the specific bolt wasn't in that container. So perhaps I need to check if the exact size is present.

Wait, no. In this case, the user is asking about M6 by 55mm, which matches the M6-1.0x55mm bolts in A-01-001. So it's valid.

So putting it all together: the response should be a speak action stating that the container for those bolts is A-01-001.
</think>

The user is asking about the location of M6 by 55mm bolts. Based on the provided data, these bolts are located in container A-01-001.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases

  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Can you take me to a Dewalt power drill?"" Let me go through this step by step.

First, I should check if there are any waypoints associated with a Dewalt power drill. From the data provided, I see several waypoints in section A with various items like M6 bolts and locknuts, but nothing related to tools or brands like Dewalt.

Next, I need to consider whether ""Dewalt"" might be part of a waypoint code. Looking at the available codes (A-01-001, etc.), there's no mention of ""Dewalt."" So it doesn't seem like any existing waypoint has this in its name or keywords.

I also have to think about edge cases. Maybe the user misspoke or used an incorrect code. But since none of the waypoints match ""Dewalt,"" I can't assume they meant a different part number or similar item.

Another angle: perhaps the Dewalt drill is stored without a specific waypoint, but that's unlikely given the structured system provided. The data shows each tool has its own code, so if it were there, it would have an entry.

Therefore, since ""Dewalt power drill"" doesn't correspond to any available waypoint and isn't part of any keyword set for the existing waypoints, I should respond that this waypoint doesn't exist.

The user is asking to be taken to a Dewalt power drill. Checking the provided waypoints, none are associated with tools or brands like Dewalt. The request does not match any available waypoints.

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 40.0, Y-Coordinate: 40.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Alright, so I have this user request: ""I need a new battery for my Milwaukee impact, can you bring me one?"" Let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that the robot is supposed to handle requests by navigating to specific containers and then returning to the starting point. The key here is figuring out which container has the battery the user needs.

The user mentioned ""Milwaukee impact,"" which likely refers to a Milwaukee tool, probably an impact wrench or driver. Milwaukee tools often have specific parts, so I'm thinking about what kind of battery they might use. Typically, these tools use certain types of rechargeable batteries, maybe 18V or 20V, but the user didn't specify.

Looking at the available containers in section A, I see several with M6 bolts, but none listed specifically for batteries. Wait, there's a container A-01-001 that has ""Milwaukee Power Drill."" Maybe that container also has related accessories like batteries? It's a stretch, but perhaps the user expects the battery to be in the same section or near that container.

I need to check if any containers have ""battery"" as part of their items. From the examples given earlier, there was a mention of a Milwaukee Power Drill in A-01-001, but no batteries listed. So, maybe the user is mistaken or assuming that the battery is there.

Since none of the containers explicitly list a battery, I can't find an exact match. The robot's logic would check each container against the request. If it doesn't find a battery in any container, it should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

Wait, but maybe the user intended to refer to the power drill as needing a battery. So perhaps the robot navigates to A-01-001, which has the Milwaukee Power Drill, and then brings that back, assuming the user needs a part related to it, like the battery.

But in the example given earlier, when the user asked for M6 locknuts, the robot went to A-01-001. So maybe the same logic applies here: if the item isn't found, but there's an associated container, go there and report that it would bring the related item.

Alternatively, since no battery is listed, the robot should say it doesn't exist. But in the example where the user asked for M6-1.0x55mm bolts from A-01-001, which didn't have them, it responded with an invalid request message.

So in this case, since there's no battery listed, the robot should say it doesn't exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's query: ""I need a set of boots, do you have anything in size 9.5?"" 

First, I'll look through the available waypoints provided. There are several containers in section A with codes like A-01-001 and others, each containing different items such as M6 bolts or M8 locknuts. None of these mention boots or any footwear.

Next, I check if ""boots"" or ""size 9.5"" match any of the keywords associated with the containers. The keywords include terms like 'bolts,' 'washers,' and specific measurements related to those items. There's no mention of footwear or sizes in the available data.

I also need to consider edge cases, like if there was a misnamed or ambiguous command. But since boots aren't listed anywhere, it's clear that the user is asking for something not present in the system.

Therefore, after reviewing all possibilities and ensuring there's no match, I conclude that the waypoint doesn't exist and should return the appropriate error message.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so the user is asking where they can find a 10-millimeter wrench. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the user is looking for. They're specifically asking about a wrench that's 10 millimeters in size. Now, looking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there are several containers in section A with different codes and contents related to M6 bolts of various lengths.

I'll go through each container one by one:

1. **A-05-123**: This has M6-1.0x55mm bolts. While it's an M6 bolt, the wrench size for M6 is typically 8mm or 9mm, not 10mm.
   
2. **A-06-124**: Contains M6-1.0x55mm and M6-1.0x60mm bolts. Again, these are M6 sizes, which don't require a 10mm wrench.

3. **A-07-125**: Holds M6-1.0x45mm bolts. Same issue as above; the wrench needed is smaller than 10mm.

Since none of these containers have M10 bolts or wrenches, and all are related to M6, it's clear that a 10mm wrench isn't available in any of them. Therefore, the user's request can't be fulfilled with the given information.
</think>

The actions array is empty because the system couldn't find the requested item in the specified container.

  ""actions"": []

"Role: You control a robot that navigates through a warehouse using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests—taking into account potential typos or misnamed parts—and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:

When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases

Alright, I've got a user query that says ""Take me to everything Milwaukee."" Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what they're asking for. They want to go to a container related to Milwaukee, but the exact details are unclear.

Looking at the provided waypoints, each has keywords like M6 bolts or other items. I don't see any that explicitly mention ""Milwaukee"" in either the name or the keywords. So, it's possible they're referring to tools or products from Milwaukee, a common brand for power tools.

Since none of the containers have ""Milwaukee"" mentioned, maybe the user is thinking of a specific tool that's not listed. Without more details, it's hard to pinpoint exactly which container to go to. I can't assume any because I don't want to send the robot to the wrong place or waste time checking each one.

I should respond by letting them know I can't find such a container and ask for more specifics. That way, they can provide clearer instructions, like a bin code or specific item name.
</think>

The user's request is to go to ""everything Milwaukee,"" but none of the available waypoints explicitly reference ""Milwaukee."" After reviewing the provided waypoints and their associated keywords, there does not appear to be any container that matches this criteria. 

To fulfill this request, I would need more specific information about which container or item the user is referring to.

```json

  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""

"Role: You control a robot that navigates through a warehouse using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests—taking into account potential typos or misnamed parts—and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.

Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user is asking, ""Take me to each kind of M6 bolt."" Hmm, so they want to visit all the containers that have different types of M6 bolts.

First, I should figure out which containers are relevant. From the given data, there are several containers in section A with M6 bolts of varying lengths and specifications. Each container has a unique code like A-01-001, A-02-002, etc., along with specific bolt details.

I need to parse the user's request carefully. They mentioned ""each kind"" which implies they want to visit every container that holds a different M6 bolt. So I should list all these containers and plan a path that covers each one.

But wait, the system can only perform a limited number of actions based on navigate, speak, and wait. The response should be a series of actions starting from the current location, moving to each container in sequence, then returning to the starting point.

I should ensure that after visiting all containers, the robot navigates back to the starting point (0,0). Also, between each move, there's no need for waiting unless specified. 

However, looking at the examples provided, when the user asks to go to multiple places, the response is a list of navigate actions followed by speak and then returning. But in this case, since it's ""each kind,"" maybe I should confirm if they want me to visit each one or just inform them about their locations.

Wait, the user didn't specify whether they need to collect items or just know where they are. Since the response examples include navigating to a container and then back, perhaps I should assume they want to go through each container sequentially.

So, I'll list all the M6 containers, create navigate actions for each in order, add a speak action after each visit, and finally return to the starting point.

But wait again, how many containers are there? Let's check the given data. There are four M6-related containers:

1. A-01-001: M6 bolts
2. A-02-002: M6 x 1.0mm bolts
3. A-03-003: M6 locknuts
4. A-04-004: M6-1.0x55mm bolts

So, four containers in total. Each should be visited one after another.

But in the example responses, sometimes only one navigate action is included. So maybe I need to structure it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects a single response that includes all necessary steps.

Wait, no. The system's examples show that each action is processed sequentially. So if there are four containers, the actions would be four navigate commands, followed by speaks, and then return home.

But in this case, since the user said ""each kind,"" maybe I should inform them about each container's location instead of physically moving to each one. However, the examples show that when a specific container is requested, it navigates there.

I think the correct approach here is to navigate sequentially to each M6-related container. But considering the system's limitations and examples, perhaps it's better to take the user through all containers step by step, but the example responses only show moving to one location at a time.

Wait, no, in the first example, ""grab some windshield wiper fluid,"" they go to C-06-161. Then another example with A1-05. So perhaps for each container, it's a separate action.

But how can I represent visiting multiple containers in one query? The user is asking to take them to each kind of M6 bolt, so that implies visiting all applicable containers.

However, the system might not support multi-step navigation without additional instructions. So perhaps the correct response is to list all the containers and their locations, as per the example where it answers with a speak action about the container's location.

In the fourth example, when asked about Milwaukee Power Drill, it responds by speaking the container's name. So maybe in this case, I should do the same: tell the user that there are multiple M6 bolt containers and provide their locations.

But the user specifically said ""Take me to each kind,"" which implies they want to move physically to each location. However, since the system can only perform navigate actions one at a time, perhaps it's not feasible to go through all in a single response without additional processing.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The user is asking for each kind of M6 bolt, which are in specific containers with unique codes. So I should identify all these containers and include navigate actions for each, followed by speak actions acknowledging the visit, then returning home.

So the plan would be:

1. Navigate to A-01-001, speak about M6 bolts.
2. Then navigate to A-02-002, speak about M6 x 1.0mm.
3. Next, go to A-03-003 for locknuts.
4. After that, proceed to A-04-004 for the 55mm bolts.
5. Finally, return home.

But in the examples, only one navigate action is included per response. So perhaps I should handle this as multiple separate actions or inform the user about each container's location instead.

Wait, but the system can process multiple actions in a single response. Looking at the example where the user asks to go through several steps (like picking up items), the assistant includes all necessary navigate and speak actions in one go.

So yes, I think it's acceptable to include all four containers' navigation commands, each followed by a speak action, then return home.
</think>

To address the user's request of visiting each container with M6 bolts, we will structure the response to sequentially navigate through each relevant container. Each visit is followed by a brief acknowledgment, and finally, we return to the starting point.

**Actions:**

1. **Navigate to A-01-001**: Move from (0,0) to (Aisle A, Section 01).
   - **Speak**: ""Arrived at A-01-001, home of standard M6 bolts.""
2. **Navigate to A-02-002**: Proceed to the next section in Aisle A.
   - **Speak**: ""Reached A-02-002, featuring M6 x 1.0mm bolts.""
3. **Navigate to A-03-003**: Move further along Aisle A for locknuts.
   - **Speak**: ""Now at A-03-003, home of M6 locknuts.""
4. **Navigate to A-04-004**: Continue to the final section in Aisle A.
   - **Speak**: ""Arrived at A-04-004, offering M6-1.0x55mm bolts.""
5. **Return Home**: Navigate back to (0,0) after completing all visits.

This sequence ensures each container is visited in order, providing the user with the locations and types of M6 bolts available.","To address the user's request of visiting each container with M6 bolts, we will structure the response to sequentially navigate through each relevant container.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts, then take me to the M6 steel nuts, then let's grab some M6 washers.""

First, I'll break down each part of the command. The user is asking for three items in sequence: M6x1.0-25mm bolts, M6 steel nuts, and M6 washers. Each item likely resides in a specific container.

Looking at the available waypoints, I see containers A-01-001 to A-09-001, each containing different M6 items. The first part of the request is for M6x1.0-25mm bolts. From the data provided, A-03-001 has M6-1.0x25mm bolts at (250, 30). So I'll navigate there.

Next, the user asks for M6 steel nuts. The closest match is probably in A-04-001, which contains M6 steel nuts at (400, 30). After that, they want M6 washers, which should be in A-05-001 at (500, 30).

I'll process each step: navigate to the first container, then proceed sequentially to the next two. After each retrieval, I'll move back to the starting point.

But wait, do I need to pick up items or just navigate? The examples show that after navigating, a speak action confirms what's being picked up. So I should include a speak action after each navigation except the last one, which might not require it if there's no item to pick up. However, in this case, all three steps involve picking up something, so I'll add a speak action for each.

I also need to ensure that the commands are processed in order without any deviations. So first bolts, then nuts, then washers. Each time, navigate to the container, confirm with a speak action, and return to the starting point before moving on to the next item.

I should check if all these containers exist and have the correct items. From the data, yes, each container has exactly one type of M6 item as specified. So it's safe to proceed with these steps.

Finally, after completing all three tasks, I'll navigate back to the starting point for the last step.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Alright, let's break down this user query: ""Can you get me some M6 washers? Actually nevermind."" 

First, I notice that the user initially asked for M6 washers. But then they quickly change their mind with ""nevermind,"" which is a common way to revoke or cancel a previous request.

I need to determine if the robot should process the initial request despite the subsequent cancellation. The key here is to identify the intent behind ""nevermind."" It's likely the user doesn't want any action taken after all.

Looking at the guidelines, when the user retracts their request, the appropriate response should acknowledge that they changed their mind without fulfilling the original task. So, the robot should respond by saying it won't get the M6 washers because the user asked not to proceed.

I also need to structure the response correctly, using a speak action to inform the user about canceling the request and another to clarify that no M6 washers were found. This ensures the user is informed clearly and the robot doesn't take unnecessary actions.

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 200.0, Y-Coordinate: 500.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user said, ""Go get me part number B-08-199 and come back."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user is asking the robot to retrieve a specific part, which has the number B-08-199. From the examples given, I see that parts are usually in containers located in different sections of a warehouse or storage area. Each container has a unique code and coordinates.

Looking at the provided waypoint information, there's no container named B-08-199. The existing containers are all under section A with codes like A-01-001, A-02-045, etc., each located at specific x and y coordinates. Since the user mentioned part number B-08-199, which isn't listed among the available waypoints, I can conclude that this part doesn't exist in the known containers.

I should check if there's any possibility that B-08-199 might be a misinterpretation or typo. Maybe it refers to another container code that sounds similar? But looking at the existing codes, none start with B-08. The closest is A-06-161, but that's under section A, and the code structure doesn't match.

The user also mentioned ""come back,"" which implies they want the robot to return after fetching the part. However, since the part doesn't exist, there's no need to navigate anywhere; instead, I should inform them of the issue.

In the supported edge cases, it says that if the waypoint isn't found, output an error message saying the waypoint doesn't exist. So in this case, the response should be a speak action indicating that B-08-199 isn't available.

I don't need to include any navigate actions here because there's nowhere to go. The robot starts at the starting point, so after the error message, it would just stay put or return to the start if needed, but since the part doesn't exist, movement isn't necessary.

Therefore, the correct response is a single speak action informing the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: ""Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts, then let's grab some M6 washers and nuts for it too."" 

First, I'll break down the request into parts. The user wants two things done sequentially: go to a specific container for bolts and then get washers and nuts from another container.

Looking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there are several containers in section A with different codes and coordinates. Each has items related to M6 bolts but with varying lengths and other components.

The first part of the request is about M6x1.0-25mm bolts. From the data, I see that container A-03-199 holds M6x1.0-25mm bolts at coordinates (1990, 90). So, the robot should navigate there.

After retrieving the bolts, the user wants to grab M6 washers and nuts. The available containers for these are A-04-301 and A-05-305. Both have different items: A-04 has M6 washers, and A-05 has M6 nuts. So, I need to decide which container to go to next.

Since the user mentioned both washers and nuts, the robot should visit both containers. However, since each navigate action can only target one location at a time, it would make sense to first go to A-04 for washers and then to A-05 for nuts. Alternatively, if the robot can carry multiple items in one trip, but based on the examples provided, each step is separate.

Wait, looking back at the example given, when the user asked for two items, the response only navigated once. So perhaps I should check if both washers and nuts are present in a single container or if they're in different ones.

In this case, the washers are in A-04-301, and nuts are in A-05-305. So, the robot needs to go to each one separately after the bolts.

But let's check the structure of the response. The user's example shows that for multiple items, they might be retrieved in a single step if possible. However, since each container is different, it would require two navigate actions: first to A-03-199 for bolts, then to A-04-301 for washers, and then to A-05-305 for nuts.

Alternatively, maybe the robot can handle this in a single trip if all three items are in one place. But from the data given, they're in different containers.

So, the actions would be:

1. Navigate to A-03-199 (M6x1.0-25mm bolts).
2. Speak confirmation.
3. Navigate back to starting point? Or proceed to next container.

Wait, but after taking the bolts, the robot needs to go to another container for washers and nuts. So it would be:

1. Go to A-03-199, pick up bolts.
2. Then go to A-04-301 for washers.
3. Then go to A-05-305 for nuts.

But each of these steps requires navigating from the starting point or from one container to another. However, the example shows that after retrieving an item, it navigates back to the starting point before moving on. But in this case, since it's a single command with two parts, maybe it should go sequentially without returning to start in between.

Wait, looking at the first example, when the robot goes to a container and then returns to the starting point after speaking. So perhaps each retrieve step is followed by returning home before the next action.

Alternatively, the robot can make multiple trips: go to A-03-199, return home; then go to A-04-301, return home; then go to A-05-305, return home. But that would be inefficient and unnecessary if all items are in section A.

Alternatively, perhaps the robot can go to each container one after another without returning home between. So:

1. Navigate to A-03-199.
2. Speak about bolts.
3. Then navigate to A-04-301 for washers.
4. Speak about washers.
5. Then navigate to A-05-305 for nuts.
6. Speak about nuts.
7. Finally, return home.

This seems logical as it minimizes the number of moves.

But I need to check if each container is indeed present and has the required items. From the data provided:

A-03-199: M6x1.0-25mm bolts – yes.

A-04-301: M6 washers – yes.

A-05-305: M6 nuts – yes.

So, all three items are in separate containers within section A. Therefore, the robot should navigate to each one in sequence.

But wait, the user's command is to first go to the bolts and then grab the washers and nuts. So perhaps after retrieving the bolts, it goes to both washer and nut containers. But since they're separate, two more steps are needed.

Alternatively, maybe the washers and nuts are in the same container? Looking back, no—each has different items.

Therefore, the response should include navigating to A-03-199, then A-04-301, then A-05-305, each time speaking about the respective item, and finally returning home after each retrieval or after all are done.

But in the examples, each retrieve is followed by a return home. So perhaps the robot should go to each container one at a time, pick up the items, speak confirmation, then return home before moving on.

So the sequence would be:

1. Go to A-03-199.
2. Speak about bolts.
3. Return home.
4. Go to A-04-301.
5. Speak about washers.
6. Return home.
7. Go to A-05-305.
8. Speak about nuts.
9. Return home.

But that might be overkill, as the user's command is a single request, not multiple separate ones. Alternatively, perhaps it's treated as a single task where the robot goes through each container in one go without returning home until all items are retrieved.

However, based on the example provided earlier, the response was to navigate to the specific container and then back home after speaking, implying that each retrieve is an independent action.

In this case, since the user's command includes two parts (bolts and then washers/nuts), it might be treated as a single task where all items are retrieved in one go. But I'm not sure if the robot can carry multiple items without returning home. Therefore, to play it safe, perhaps each retrieve is done separately with return trips.

Alternatively, maybe the robot should first go to A-03-199 for bolts, then from there directly to A-04-301 and A-05-305 without going back home in between. That would be more efficient but might complicate the path planning beyond the scope of the examples given.

Given that the user's example had a single navigate action followed by return, I think each retrieve should be its own step with a return home. Therefore, the response will involve three navigate actions, each followed by speaking and returning home.

So the final response would include:

1. Navigate to A-03-199, speak about bolts, return home.
2. Navigate to A-04-301, speak about washers, return home.
3. Navigate to A-05-305, speak about nuts, return home.

But the user's command is a single sentence, so perhaps it should be treated as a multi-step action without returning home between steps. Therefore, after retrieving the bolts, proceed directly to get washers, then nuts, and finally return home once all are retrieved.

This would make the response more efficient but requires assuming the robot can handle multiple items or at least plan a path that visits multiple containers in one trip.

In conclusion, the most logical approach is to navigate sequentially to each container for the required items without returning home until all are collected.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Required Items:** The user needs M6x1.0-25mm bolts, M6 washers, and M6 nuts.

2. **Locate Containers with Required Items:**
   - Bolts: A-03-199 (M6x1.0-25mm)
   - Washers: A-04-301 (M6)
   - Nuts: A-05-305 (M6)

3. **Plan Efficient Navigation:** Visit each container in sequence without returning home between retrieves to minimize travel distance.

4. **Execute Navigation and Retrieval:**
   - Navigate to A-03-199, retrieve bolts, speak confirmation.
   - Proceed to A-04-301, retrieve washers, speak confirmation.
   - Proceed to A-05-305, retrieve nuts, speak confirmation.

5. **Return Home After All Retrievals:** Ensure the robot returns home once all items are collected.

**Final Answer:**

The robot will navigate sequentially to each container in section A to retrieve the required items without returning home between each retrieval, then return home after all items have been collected.

The robots starting location to begin navigation from and to return to for fetching or return tasks X-Coordinate: 0.0, Y-Coordinate: 0.0

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, so I need to figure out where the user is asking for M8 washers. Let me go through the steps.

First, I check the available waypoints in section C because that's where the user mentioned. But looking at the data, all the C section points have M6 bolts or similar items. There's no mention of M8 washers anywhere. 

I remember from the rules that if after applying the keyword matching tolerance and other checks, the waypoint isn't found, I should respond that it doesn't exist.

So, in this case, since none of the waypoints in section C have M8 washers listed as keywords or part of their names, I can't find the container. Therefore, I'll output the error message.
</think>

The requested item ""M8 washers"" is not found in any available waypoints, so the response should indicate that the waypoint does not exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:

Okay, so I've received a user query: ""Can you grab me 12 M3 washers?"" I need to figure out how to respond appropriately based on the guidelines provided.

First, let's parse the query. The user is asking for 12 M3 washers. They didn't mention any specific bin or section code, so I'll have to rely on the information given in the problem.

Looking at the available data, all the bins listed (A-06-101, A-05-102, etc.) contain bolts and nuts of different sizes but not washers. Specifically, none of them are labeled as having M3 washers. The closest is bin A-05-102 with M6 locknuts, which isn't relevant here.

According to the guidelines, if the requested item isn't found in any bin, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. Since there's no M3 washer mentioned anywhere, it fits this scenario.

I need to make sure my response is clear and follows the structure specified: an ""speak"" action indicating the error.

```json

  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",

"Role: You control a robot that navigates through a warehouse using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests—taking into account potential typos or misnamed parts—and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:

Okay, so the user is asking me to ""grab me some melatonin."" Hmm, let's see. First, I need to figure out if melatonin is something that can be found in any of the containers mentioned.

Looking back at the provided data, there are several containers listed with different items. Let me check each one:

- A-01-001 has M6 locknuts.
- A-02-002 has WD40.
- A-03-003 has M8 bolts.
- A-04-004 has masking tape.
- B-01-005 has AAA batteries.
- B-02-006 has paperclips.

Wait, none of these containers have melatonin. Melatonin is a medication or supplement used for sleep, so it's probably not stored in the same place as tools or office supplies. 

Since the user mentioned needing it to sleep, maybe they keep it at home or in another area that isn't part of the container system I know about. But based on the information given, there's no container with melatonin.

I should respond by letting them know that melatonin isn't available in any of the listed containers and perhaps suggest they check elsewhere.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

    ]

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for here. They said, ""Take me to each kind of bolt."" Hmm, so they want me to go through all the different types of bolts available.

Looking at the data provided, I see there are several waypoints in section A, specifically from A-01-001 to A-06-001. Each of these has bolts with varying specifications like M8x1.25 and M6-1.0x55mm. 

The user wants me to visit each one. But wait, the system is designed to handle multiple actions in sequence. So I need to plan a path that goes from the starting point to each of these waypoints and then back.

First, I'll start at (0,0). Then navigate to A-01-001, which is at (500, 200). After that, go to A-02-001 at (600, 300), then A-03-001 at (700, 400), followed by A-04-001 at (800, 500). Next, A-05-001 is at (900, 600), and finally A-06-001 at (1000, 700).

After visiting all these points, I should return to the starting point. But I need to make sure each navigate action includes the correct x and y coordinates based on their respective positions.

I also have to structure this in JSON format as per the requirements, listing each action in order. So, the actions will be a series of navigate commands followed by returning home.
</think>

To respond to the user's request to visit each kind of bolt, we need to identify all waypoints that contain bolts and navigate through them sequentially.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Bolt Containers**: From the provided data, there are multiple waypoints in section A (e.g., A-01-001, A-02-001, etc.) containing different types of bolts.
   
2. **Plan Navigation Path**: The robot will need to navigate sequentially from one bolt container to another.

3. **Return to Starting Point**: After visiting all bolt containers, the robot should return to the starting point.

**Output:**

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want me to go get ""part number B 08 199."" Hmm, that seems a bit vague. First, I'll check if this part number matches any of the containers I have access to. Looking at the list provided, all the containers are in section A with codes like A-08-199 and others. 

Wait, the user mentioned ""B 08 199,"" which starts with a B instead of an A. None of my containers are labeled with a B. Maybe it's a typo or maybe they're referring to a different section altogether. I should consider if ""B 08 199"" could be another way of writing a container code, perhaps without the hyphen? 

Looking at the examples given earlier, when someone says something like ""A1-05,"" it's interpreted as A1-05-113. So maybe ""B 08 199"" is supposed to translate into B-08-199 or something similar. But I don't have any containers starting with B. 

I'll also check the part number they mentioned: ""part number B 08 199."" None of my containers list a part number like that. The parts in each container are things like M6 locknuts, which are specific sizes and types. So I don't see anything matching ""B 08 199"" either.

Since the user is asking for something that doesn't exist in the available containers, I should respond by saying it's an invalid request. According to the instructions, if none of the waypoints match, I have to output a speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user says, ""I need a sample of all of our windshield washer fluid."" Hmm, first, I need to understand what they're asking for. They want a sample from each container that has windshield washer fluid.

Looking at the provided data, there are containers in section A and C. Specifically, container A-01-001 has windshield wiper fluid, and C-06-161 also has it. So I need to navigate to both of these locations.

I should check if there's a way to do this efficiently. Since the user mentioned ""all,"" they probably want samples from each container. That means I might have to go to section A first, get the sample, then move on to section C, and so on if there are more containers.

Wait, but in the provided example, the response only includes going to one location, A-01-001, picking up the fluid, speaking about it, and returning. Maybe I should follow that structure but include both sections. Or perhaps the user expects me to go to each section sequentially.

I need to make sure each action is clear and in order. So first, navigate to A-01-001, then pick up the sample, speak about it, return to starting point, then go to C-06-161, do the same again, and finally return. That would cover all containers.

But wait, looking back at the example response, only one container was addressed. Maybe I should check if there's a limit or if ""all"" requires visiting each one. Since the user specified ""all,"" it's better to include both sections in my actions.

So, I'll plan to navigate to A-01-001 first, then speak about picking up the fluid, return, go to C-06-161, repeat the steps, and then come back to the starting point. That way, all samples are collected as per the user's request.

I should also ensure that each action is sequential without any errors or unsupported actions. Using only navigate, speak, and wait if necessary, but in this case, no waiting is needed.

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request: ""Go get me part number B-08-199."" 

First, I'll analyze the query. The user is asking for a specific part number, B-08-199. Looking at the provided waypoints, none of them have that exact code. The available parts are all under codes like A-01-001 with M6 bolts.

I should check if there's any possibility I'm misunderstanding the code. Maybe it's a typo or a different naming convention? But no, B-08-199 doesn't match anything in the given list.

Next, I need to determine the appropriate response. Since the waypoint doesn't exist, according to the guidelines, I should output an error message saying so. 

I'll structure the response with a speak action indicating that the part doesn't exist and suggest checking the number again.

The user is asking for a part number that isn't available in our system. Here's how we handle it:

**Response:**

Each waypoint is defined by a unique location code (e.g., ""B-86-109"") and represents a container that holds items. The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.
Available Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.


# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

Ignore Extra Tokens:

  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""WH-A12 B-86-109"" as ""B-86-109"".

Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:

  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.
  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint’s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.
  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.
  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.
  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.
  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)
Strict Match Requirement:

  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.
  

Invalid Waypoint Response:

  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }

# Handling Complex Commands
Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.


# Supported Edge Cases
Unknown or Misnamed Waypoint:

  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
      }
    ]
  }
Ambiguous or Invalid Commands:

  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.
Unsupported Actions:

  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:
  {
    ""actions"": [
      {
        ""action"": ""speak"",
        ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
      }
    ]
  }

Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: ""Take me to every vehicle fluid."" Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the structure of the request. The user is asking to be taken to multiple locations, specifically mentioning ""every vehicle fluid."" This implies they want to visit several containers related to different vehicle fluids.

Looking back at the provided data, there are several waypoints listed under section A and C. From the examples given, it seems that each section has specific bins with particular items. For instance, in section C, bin 06-161 holds windshield wiper fluid, and bin 03-250 has engine oil.

The user's instruction is to go to ""every"" vehicle fluid, so I need to identify all the relevant containers. From the data, these would include:

1. Section C, bin 06-161 for windshield wiper fluid.
2. Section C, bin 03-250 for engine oil.

I should check if there are more bins in other sections that contain vehicle fluids, but based on the examples provided, it seems only these two are relevant.

Next, I need to plan the navigation sequence. The user probably wants the robot to visit each of these locations in an efficient order. Typically, visiting closer points first makes sense, so perhaps section C, bin 06-161 (which is at x=1610, y=300) and then section C, bin 03-250 (x=250, y=30). However, without exact coordinates for all bins, I might need to assume the order based on the provided examples.

After visiting each location, the robot should confirm that it has picked up the fluids. Then, it should return to the starting point after completing all deliveries or pickups.

I also need to ensure that each action is properly sequenced: navigate to the first container, speak confirmation, then move to the next, and so on, before returning home.

One thing I'm unsure about is whether ""every vehicle fluid"" refers only to these two items or if there are more. Since the data provided doesn't list others, I'll proceed with the ones available.

Finally, I must structure the response in JSON format, listing each action step-by-step as per the user's instructions and the examples given.
