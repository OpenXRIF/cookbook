# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's try to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want me to take them to the Forumla Electric Mech Bay. First, I need to understand what that waypoint might be called or represented by.

Looking at the available waypoints, there's a waypoint named ""Formulaelectric ideas clinic."" That sounds familiar because it includes both the formula and some idea-related terms like clinic. So, the core identifier is probably ""Formulaelectric.""

Now, checking the keywords for Formulaelectric ideas clinic: [""formula"", ""electric"", ""ideas"", ""clinic""]. The query is asking about "" Forumla Electric Mech Bay,"" which might mean something similar but with a different suffix.

I need to see if ""Forumla"" or ""Formulae"" are part of this waypoint's name. If the waypoint isn't named exactly, I should consider possible matches like ""Formulaelectric mech bay."" That would include both formula, electric, and mech (mechanical) components.

So, since the query doesn't specify a keyword directly related to mech or bay, but if ""Formulaelectric ideas clinic"" is our main reference, then ""Forumla Electric Mech Bay"" might be what we're targeting. Therefore, it's possible that this isn't an existing waypoint and needs to be recognized as such.

Given that, the response should inform the user about the invalid request by mentioning ""This waypoint does not exist.""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Okay, let's see. The user said, ""By car is dirty, take me to the washbay."" Hmm, I need to figure out what that means. So, first, I should break it down.

They mentioned using a car, which makes me think of navigation. But then they say ""take me to the washbay."" Wait, washbay... isn't that one of those waypoints? Yes, from the user's prompt earlier, there was a mention of ""Wash Bay"" as part of their notes.

So, the user is asking to take them to the washbay. That should be straightforward. I need to make sure they can navigate there. The available keywords for washbay are probably [""wash"", ""bay""] and maybe the waypoint name itself. 

The command says by car is dirty, but that's more about instructions on how to get somewhere. So, the main action needed is navigation from their current location to Wash Bay.

I should check if I have to break this down into multiple actions or just one. Since it's a single request, I can probably handle it with just a navigate command. That makes sense and doesn't require any extra actions beyond what's necessary.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. The user wants a ""big space"" where they can work, but instead of taking them to that space, the person is going somewhere else—specifically, an open area. 

First, I'll look at the available waypoints to see if any include ""space."" Checking each one: C&D - Coffee Area, D & E - Idea Zone, and RoboHub. None of these mention ""space,"" so that's a problem.

Next, I need to follow the rules for keyword matching. The user didn't provide extra tokens after their query, so I ignore them. Now, I check if any waypoint includes the core identifier related to a space. ""Coffee Area"" and ""Space Zone"" aren't present in the available waypoints provided. 

Since none of the waypoints have ""space"" or a similar keyword, there's no valid waypoint that matches this request. According to the rules, if extra tokens are ignored and nothing fits, I should output an error action.

I also need to ensure I'm only using predefined actions like navigate, speak, or wait. Since it's about moving around without any of these, ""speak"" won't work here, so that becomes my action with an input error message.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's query about a chamber and identify it as a specific waypoint. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user says, ""Isn't there a quite chamber around here, where is that?"" They're asking for direction to a chamber. My task is to determine if this is one of the predefined waypoints and extract the relevant information from their input.

Looking at the provided context, I see there are several waypoints listed with their locations. For example, ""RoboHub Entrance"" is located at (25, 50), and ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic"" is at (25, 75). The user's query mentions a chamber around them without specifying which one.

I'll start by applying the rules for keyword matching. The input here is about finding a chamber. I need to ignore any extra tokens, so ""chamber"" is fine as it is. Next, check if this contains any keywords or the names of the waypoints.

Looking at the waypoint definitions:
- Ideas Clinic: includes 'ideas' and 'clinic'
- RoboHub Entrance: has 'robohub' and 'entrance'
- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic: includes 'ideas'

Since the user is referring to a chamber, but none of the waypoints have ""chamber"" in their names or keywords. So, this doesn't match any known waypoint.

I should then check for extra actions beyond just navigate, speak, and wait. The query seems more about location than moving around, which might involve waiting. But since it's not a specific command from the list, I need to output an error.

Putting it all together, because there's no matching waypoint, the response should mention that this doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking. They want me to determine if the machine shop exists based on the given waypoints and their keywords.

First, I need to check each available waypoint. The machine shop is listed as ""Machine Shop"" with a keyword set of [""machine"", ""shop""]. So the core identifier here is ""Shop"".

Next, I'll consider any extra tokens or prefixes in the query. The user's query doesn't have any alphanumeric codes or other prefixes beyond just starting at (0, 0), which I ignore.

Now, I'll look for keywords related to the machine shop. The keyword list includes ""machine"" and ""shop"". In the context of the query, ""Machine Shop"" matches these keywords directly. 

I don't see any other waypoint that might be relevant because the only one with a similar structure is ""Shop"", which doesn't match the query word. Therefore, since the input ""Machine Shop"" matches the keyword set and isn't covered by another waypoint, it should be recognized as existing.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Words associated with the waypoint, North Entrance are Door, Garage Door, Parking Lot B, Bus Station, SDC Vehicle, Truck, Van, RAV4.",34,E5-1,1.0,14.0,"""Do you know there the welding room is?""","<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They asked, ""Do you know there the welding room is?"" Hmm, that's asking if they recognize where the welding room is. 

First, I need to look at the available waypoints and their corresponding keywords. From the data provided, I see a waypoint named ""welding room"" with the keywords [""welding"", ""room""]. So when the user mentions ""welding room,"" it should match this waypoint.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The available waypoint names are:
- ideas clinic
- ideas room
- robot hub entrance
- robohub
- robocenter
- welding room

Each has specific keywords. Since the user is asking about the welding room, their query seems to be a request for that location. 

I remember rule 3, which states that after ignoring extra tokens, if the input doesn't match any of the keywords or words in the waypoint name, it's invalid. In this case, ""welding room"" directly matches with the keyword ""welding."" So there shouldn't be any extra tokens to ignore because the query is clear.

So, according to rule 4, if none of the waypoints match, I should output an error response. Since ""welding room"" is present, it should work without issues.

I don't think there's a need for more actions here. The user just wants confirmation about the location, which is straightforward.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to address the user's query. They asked, ""Do you know there the machine shop instructor room is?"" First, let me break this down.

The user wants to know if they can locate the ""machine shop instructor room"" waypoint. From the context provided, each waypoint has a name and some keywords that match its description. 

Looking at the available waypoints: MachineShopInstructorRoom, MachineShopInstructorOffice, Room1427Ideas Clinic, RoboHubEntrance, Room1651B894Etc, Room1501A37, Room1501R27, Room1501V38, and Space1001D. 

Each of these has specific keywords that might match the user's query. But ""machine shop instructor room"" doesn't seem to be one of them. The nearest is MachineShopInstructorOffice, which likely refers to an office, not a room.

I should check if there are any waypoint definitions related to ""machine shop instructor"". Scanning through each available waypoint, none mention this term directly. So, it's safe to assume that this room doesn't exist based on the given data.

Therefore, my response should indicate that I can't speak with the machine shop instructor room as a specific waypoint exists. This aligns with the invalid waypoint handling rules and ensures no extra actions are taken beyond speaking.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's question. They asked, ""What is the best team if I like racing?"" Hmm, that's a bit vague. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the context provided, there are waypoints defined with their keywords and descriptions. The user didn't mention any specific waypoint related to racing or teams. So my first thought is that without more information, it's hard to determine which team they're referring to.

I remember the rules about ignoring extra tokens—so I should start by cleaning up the input. The question doesn't seem to have any alphanumeric codes or other prefixes, so that part is just the same as the original.

Next, keyword matching. Each waypoint has keywords associated with it. But since the user didn't specify a particular word or clue related to racing or teams, I don't see how this fits into any of the predefined waypoints. The closest I can think of is ""ideas clinic,"" which relates to idea space but not directly to racing or teams.

Looking at the available keywords and waypoint names, there's no mention of anything that would indicate a specific team related to racing. Maybe if they had mentioned something like ""Racing Team X"" or ""Team Y,"" that could help. But as it stands, without such context, I can't find a matching keyword or identify a corresponding waypoint.

I also need to consider the other rules. If none of the waypoints match the keywords after ignoring extra tokens, I have to output an error response indicating that this waypoint does not exist. This would make sense here because there's no valid waypoint identified for racing teams.

Additionally, since the request doesn't specify any function beyond what's provided in the waypoints, which include ""navigate,"" ""speak,"" and ""wait,"" but there's no clear action needed or an unsupported command, I should adhere to that. The error response would cover the invalid waypoint aspect because it can't find a match for the user's query.

In summary, without more context on what specific team they're referring to based on racing, I must infer that such a team isn't defined in the provided waypoints. Therefore, the appropriate response is to acknowledge that this type of location doesn't exist and provide the error as per the guidelines.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the best team would be for someone who likes rally racing. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the context provided. There are a bunch of waypoints defined with specific keywords and locations. Each waypoint has a name (like ""ideas clinic"") and some associated keywords that should match the user's request.

The user's query is asking about the best team for rally racing. The task is to find the corresponding waypoint based on this query using keyword matching rules.

Let me look at the available waypoints and their keywords:

1. **E7 ideas clinic** with keywords [""ideas"", ""clinic""]
2. **Ideas Club** with keywords [""ideas""]
3. **Rally Racing Zone** with keywords [""rally racing""] (wait, actually, I don't see a keyword for this one yet)
4. **Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic** with keywords [""ideas"", ""clinic""]

The user's query is about rallying and racing, which suggests they're interested in rally teams or the sport itself.

Looking at the available waypoints, I see that **Rally Racing Zone** isn't explicitly listed but includes ""rally racing"" as a keyword. However, it doesn't have any associated specific locations except for the room number. 

Wait, but there's no waypoint named exactly ""Rally Racing Zone"". The closest is **Ideas Club**, which is just ""ideas"", and **E7 ideas clinic** with both ""ideas"" and ""clinic"".

Since the user mentioned rally racing, I'm leaning towards looking for a waypoint that has ""rally racing"" in its keywords. None of the existing waypoints have this exactly, but **Rally Racing Zone** might imply it's related to the sport.

However, without an explicit waypoint for ""Rally Racing Zone"", perhaps the closest is to use **Ideas Club**, which is more generic and includes the idea aspect. Alternatively, if ""Rally Racing Zone"" was available, that would be the best choice as it directly relates to rallying and racing teams.

But since it's not listed, I might have to go with the next best option, which could be **E7 ideas clinic** or **Ideas Club**, both of which include the keyword ""ideas"".

Wait, but the user specifically asked about rally racing. So maybe **Rally Racing Zone** is necessary here even if it doesn't have an exact keyword. Without a waypoint named ""Rally Racing Zone"", I might need to infer that.

Looking back at the rules, after ignoring extra tokens, if the input doesn't include any of the keywords or words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, it's invalid. Since ""rally racing"" isn't present as a keyword in any existing waypoint except for the hypothetical ""Rally Racing Zone"", which is missing an explicit location.

Therefore, without a specific waypoint for ""Rally Racing Zone"", I might have to use **Ideas Club** or **E7 ideas clinic**, even though they don't directly mention rallying. But if the user prefers more specific keywords, maybe **Rally Racing Zone** should be considered, but since it's missing, perhaps it's invalid.

Wait, actually, the query is about the best team for rally racing, not necessarily a specific location. So if none of the waypoints have ""rally racing"", then maybe it's invalid to proceed without that. But since there are other options like **E7 ideas clinic**, which include ""ideas"" and ""clinic"", perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, if I can't find a waypoint for ""Rally Racing Zone"", but all other keywords are included in the existing waypoints, then the response would be invalid because none of them match without extra tokens.

Wait, actually, no. The query is about rally racing, so it's not clear if it requires a specific team or just to refer to a general area. If there's no waypoint with ""rally racing"" as a keyword, then the request is invalid because I can't pinpoint the best team for that specific interest.

But since none of the waypoints have ""rally racing"", the response should be invalid.

Wait, let me think again. The query is about rallying and racing teams, but without a waypoint named exactly for that, perhaps the closest is to use **Ideas Club**, which is a generic term with two keywords: ""ideas"" and ""clinic"". This might not directly answer the user's query but could imply interest in teams.

Alternatively, if I can't find any relevant waypoint, the response should state that this question doesn't exist because there are no waypoints matching the keyword or the required format. So perhaps the best action is to respond with a speak action since it's invalid.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user's query is ""What is the best team if I like robots?"". First, I need to understand what they're asking for.

Looking at the available waypoints, none of them seem to mention anything about a team or leadership. The options include things like ""SpeakUp"" and ""RobotLab"", but those don't have any information about teams or collaboration.

The user is interested in robots, so perhaps they want guidance on forming an effective team with robots. However, the provided waypoint definitions don't support answering this question directly. They only offer ways to navigate around existing areas, handle keys, speak, and wait.

Since there's no relevant waypoint defined that addresses forming a robot team or leadership, I need to respond by indicating that none of the available waypoints exist for this purpose.

I should follow the rules provided. The input doesn't include any of the keywords needed for the waypoint definitions, so it falls under the invalid waypoint response category.

Therefore, the appropriate action is to output an error message asking the user if they have access to a valid waypoint that can help with their query.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's question. They want to know which design team they should join because they like electric skateboards. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that there are waypoints available in this context. Each has a set of keywords associated with them. The waypoint for electric skateboards is probably ""Electric Skateboards"" with keywords like ""electric"" and ""skateboard"". 

Looking back at the user prompt, when they mention joining a design team based on their interests, I think it's related to the keywords in the waypoint. So if the user likes electric skateboards, maybe that's part of the design team.

I don't recall any other waypoints that specifically mention ""electric"" or ""skateboard"". The main waypoint here is ""Electric Skateboards"", which likely includes the relevant keywords for design teams based on their interests. Since they're interested in electric skateboards, this should point to a specific design team.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query using the provided waypoint system. The query is ""Take me to the Formula Electric Electric Bay."" 

First, I'll parse the keywords in this query. The phrase ""Formula Electric Electric"" seems like it could be a keyword related to a specific area or zone. Looking back at the waypoints, there's one called ""Formula Electric Electric Bay,"" which might be the closest match.

Next, I need to check if any of the available waypoints have ""Formula"" in their names or as keywords. Scanning through the list:

- E7 ideas clinic
- E7 thoughts and projects
- Room 123 - Bus Station
- Room 456 - Coffee Area
- Room 789 - Parking Lot B
- RAV4 truck area

Wait, none of these seem to include ""Formula."" Hmm, that might be an issue. The query is asking for the Formula Electric Electric Bay, but the available waypoints don't have a matching keyword or name.

According to rule 3, if the cleaned input doesn't match any keywords or names, it should output an error response. So I need to process this and mention that there's no valid waypoint.

I'll structure the response by first acknowledging the query, then explaining that the Formula Electric Electric Bay isn't a recognized waypoint. Since the user is asking about something beyond the available options, they're prompted to pick something up from the nearby area or ask for help.

Putting it all together, I should explain that there's no corresponding waypoint and request further clarification.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They said, ""I love Elon Musk and tunnels, what design team should I join?"" 

First, I need to break down the request into parts. The user is expressing enthusiasm for Elon Musk but also mentions ""tunnels."" Now, looking at the available waypoints, there's one called ""Tunnels,"" which includes keywords like ""tunnels"" and ""area."" That seems relevant.

The user wants to join a design team. So, I should check if ""Design Team"" is part of any waypoint. Scanning through the list, none of the waypoints mention design teams directly except in their names or context. Wait, no—looking back, all the keywords for each waypoint are specific to certain areas like ideas, rooms, etc., not related to design teams.

Hmm, so the user might be mixing up words here. ""Tunnels"" is a keyword, but that's about locations, not people or teams. Maybe the user thinks they can join the tunnel area, which seems a bit off because tunnels aren't typically associated with design teams. 

Since there are no waypoints explicitly mentioning design teams or the design process, I should consider if any of them might be misapplied here. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused about how to approach something related to Elon Musk and tunnels, but that's not a clear prompt for joining a specific team.

Given the rules, if none of the waypoints match the keywords provided by the user, which are ""tunnels"" and ""design team,"" then I need to output an action suggesting that this waypoint doesn't exist. 

So, the response should be a speak action indicating that the required waypoint isn't available. That way, the user knows it's invalid based on their input.

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle this user's query. The query says, ""Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user is instructing a robot to move in a certain way. They want the robot to go to C&D - Main Entrance and wait there for ten minutes. But I should consider how waypoints work here. Each waypoint has specific keywords that can be matched with parts of the query.

Looking at the available waypoints: C&D ideas clinic, C&D coffee area, E7 ideas clinic, and so on. The user's command mentions ""C&D - Main Entrance,"" which is the name part. So I need to check if ""Main Entrance"" or any related words match the keywords of a waypoint.

Wait, in the given list, the keywords for each waypoint are explicitly provided. For example, C&D ideas clinic has [""ideas"", ""clinic""], C&D coffee area has [""coffee"", ""area""], and so on. The user's command doesn't mention ""Main Entrance"" or any of these words as a keyword, which means it might not directly match any available waypoint.

But I should consider if the query can be interpreted in a way that aligns with one of the waypoints. Since the query is about moving to C&D - Main Entrance and waiting there for ten minutes, maybe the keywords are part of ""C&D - Main Entrance."" Let me check the list again: no waypoint is named exactly ""C&D - Main Entrance,"" but perhaps the keyword ""Main Entrance"" could be a keyword in some waypoint.

Looking through all the waypoints, none have ""Main Entrance."" The closest might be C&D coffee area or E7 ideas clinic. Neither of these includes ""Main Entrance"" as a keyword, so it's unclear how this would match any single waypoint. 

Additionally, since the user is giving a directive to move and wait, I need to check if the function required is available. The supported functions are navigate, speak, and wait. This query only mentions moving and waiting, which are both functions that can be done with ""navigate"" (to move in space) and ""wait."" But since there's no explicit mention of ""navigate,"" it might not cover all bases.

Wait, the user didn't explicitly say they want to navigate anywhere. They just instruct about movement. So maybe I should consider if a ""navigate"" action is appropriate here. However, without specific keywords for moving around, it's unclear if this command can be translated into any existing waypoint actions.

Also, since there's no way to move in the physical space (like navigating through buildings or areas), it might not make sense to process this as a waypoint. So perhaps the best response is to output an ""invalid action"" because I don't have enough keywords or functions covered by the query.

But let me double-check: The user wants to go to C&D - Main Entrance and wait there for ten minutes. There's no waypoint named with that specific location, so matching on keywords isn't possible. Therefore, it seems like this is an invalid request because there's no way to translate this into a valid function or keyword match.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's query using the provided rules. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user said: ""Robot, go to North Entrance and wait for 15 minutes."" The available waypoint here is ""North Entrance"". Looking back at the waypoints given earlier, ""North Entrance"" has the keywords [""north"", ""entrance""], right? So that matches perfectly with what the user is asking for.

I should ignore any extra tokens at the beginning. In this case, there are no additional words before ""North Entrance"", so I can proceed without worrying about ignoring anything else.

Next, I need to check if the input contains any of the keywords or the waypoint name. The keywords here are ""north"" and ""entrance"". Yes, both are present in the query, which means it's a valid reference to the ""North Entrance"" waypoint.

Now, since there aren't multiple possible interpretations because it's just asking for a specific action without ambiguity, I don't need to choose any extra actions. The only function required is ""navigate"", as per the example queries provided.

So, I should instruct the AI to perform the ""navigate"" action with the coordinates of North Entrance. Looking back at the initial setup, the starting location is (0,0), and the user wants to go to ""North Entrance"". From my knowledge, ""North Entrance"" is located at (25,75). Therefore, I should send a ""navigate"" command with that input.

Putting it all together, the response should be a speak action requesting the navigation to North Entrance at 25,75.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

            }
        }
    ]
}

Example Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.
Example Answer:
{
  ""actions"": [

      }
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?""
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""wait"",
      ""input"": 10
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic"",
        ""x"": 25,
        ""y"": 75
      }
    }
  ]
}

First, the user's prompt was about navigating to a specific area, C&D - Hot Food Area, and waiting for 15 seconds. The input is ""Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and wait 15 seconds.""

I'll start by ignoring any extra tokens. In this case, there are no such tokens at the beginning of the query.

Next, I need to parse the remaining text: ""navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and wait 15 seconds."" The keywords here include ""robot,"" which is part of the available waypoint list for ""C&D - Hot Food Area.""

Looking at the waypoints provided, ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" has keywords like [""cand"", ""hot"", ""food""], so it definitely includes ""robot."" 

I don't see any other waypoint mentioned that starts with ""robot,"" so there's no ambiguity here. The action required is navigate, and I need to provide the correct input for that.

The user also specified waiting 15 seconds, which will go into the ""wait"" function under navigate in their API call.

So, putting it all together, I'll tell them to use the speak command with the input containing C&D - Hot Food Area and wait 15 seconds. That should fulfill both the navigate and waiting requirements.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this user prompt. The user says, ""Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes."" First, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for.

They mention a robot, so maybe the system is supposed to control a robot. They want it to move to a temporary booth and wait for 30 minutes. I should check if there's a waypoint named ""Temporary Booth"" or something similar that includes the keywords related to where the booth is located.

Looking at the available waypoints, I see one called ""Temporary Booth - Temporary Area."" That seems promising because it mentions both the location and the type of area, which probably refers to a room. So this waypoint would cover going there and waiting.

Next, I need to make sure that the keywords match. The words in ""Temporary Booth"" include "" booth,"" which could refer to the room where the temporary area is located. The location ""Temporary Area"" also includes ""area,"" which might be relevant for any type of room or space.

I don't see another waypoint that fits this request, so it must be the only option. Now, following the rules, I should process this as a navigation command because it's about moving to a specific area and waiting there.

So the response will include a ""navigate"" action with the input specifying the location of Temporary Booth - Temporary Area. That makes sense because the robot needs to move from the current position to that spot and wait for 30 minutes. I don't see any ambiguity here, so no extra actions are needed beyond what's required.

I think that covers everything. The user is clearly asking for a specific action on a particular location, so this should be straightforward.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this user's query. The user said, ""Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes."" First, I need to understand what they're asking for. It seems like they want the robot to move and wait.

Looking at the available waypoints, ""Silent Study"" is one of them. So I should check if there's a way to navigate there. The example showed that using "" navigate "" with the location gives specific instructions. Since the user asked for Silent Study and wait 10 minutes, I'll need to specify both.

I remember from the rules that after ignoring extra tokens, I should ignore any prefixes like E7 ideas or other codes. So here, there are no extra tokens, just the words given. The command says ""Robot"" but in the context of navigating, it's about moving. The waypoint is ""Silent Study,"" so I need to set the navigate function with its location.

I should structure this correctly, setting the input as {name: ""Silent Study"", x: 25, y: 75} if that's where Silent Study is located. Wait, actually, in the example, they used {x: 142, y: 75}, but I don't have the exact coordinates. Assuming it's somewhere in the room, maybe the user expects a specific point.

I should make sure to follow the strict match requirements and avoid extra actions unless necessary. Since this is a simple navigate request with waiting, no other functions are needed beyond navigate and wait. So the action list will only include ""navigate"" with the specified location.
</think>

The user has asked for the robot to proceed to the ""Silent Study"" zone and wait for 10 minutes. Based on the rules and available waypoints, we can analyze this request.

1. **Ignoring extra tokens**: The input starts directly with ""Robot,"" which is ignored as it's not an alphanumeric code or other prefix.
2. **Keyword matching**: 
   - Keyword list: [""robot"", ""proceed"", ""proceed to"", ""Silent Study""]
   - waypoint name: ""Silent Study""
3. **Strict match requirement**:
   - The cleaned input is ""Silent Study.""
   - The waypoint's name includes the keyword ""Silent Study,"" so it matches.
   - No extra tokens are left, so we don't need to ignore anything else.

Since the request is straightforward and directly matches the ""Silent Study"" waypoint with no ambiguity or ambiguity in interpretation, there's no action needed beyond what is specified.

**Actions:**
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""Silent Study"",

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down this user query. The user said, ""Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud."" Hmm, I need to figure out what they're asking for.

First, the user mentioned a robot command. They want to navigate to the North Entrance and then say that entrance out loud. So, I think they're testing if the system can perform navigation commands followed by an audio output.

Looking at the available waypoints, there's one called ""North Entrance"" with keywords like [""north"", ""entrance""]. The user is asking for two things: navigating to it and saying its name out loud. That seems straightforward.

I should check if ""North Entrance"" exists among the available options. Yes, it's listed as a waypoint. So, I don't have any issues there. Now, I need to output commands that handle both actions: navigating and speaking.

The user specified two actions: navigate and speak. So, I'll instruct the system to navigate to North Entrance with its coordinates, probably starting at (0,0) since that's the default. Then, after arriving, say ""North Entrance"" out loud.

I should make sure the commands are in order—navigate first, then speak. Also, include the coordinates where applicable if they have specific locations.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the response with two actions: navigate and speak, both following North Entrance.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. Let me read through it carefully.

The user wrote: ""Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly.""

First, I should identify the relevant keywords or waypoints from the given information. The waypoint names are things like ""C&D ideas clinic"" or similar. Looking at the options provided earlier, C&D is one of them with a corresponding description.

So, in the available waypoints, C&D - Hot Food Area seems to be part of it because the user is asking for that specific location. Let me check: there's no waypoint explicitly named as ""C&D Hot Food Area,"" but maybe it's inferred from the given list or context.

Wait, looking back, I see a waypoint called ""C&D ideas clinic."" So, if someone asks to navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area, that probably refers to a specific location within C&D. Maybe ""C&D Hot Food Area"" is an alias for C&D ideas clinic.

So the keywords here are ""navigate,"" and the name of the area is ""C&D Hot Food Area."" The question is asking to announce the area clearly when it's reached. So, I need to respond by navigating there and then announcing the name.

I should follow the rules strictly. Ignore any extra tokens first; in this case, none seem relevant here. Then check if the cleaned text includes at least one of the keywords. Since ""navigate"" is part of the query, it's included.

Next, ensure that it clearly points to the specific waypoint. Since C&D - Hot Food Area is implied from the name and the context provided, it should be valid.

So, the response should include a navigation command followed by an announcement of where it landed. But since announcements are handled separately in the supported edge cases, maybe I can handle that after navigating.

Wait, no, the user's query includes both navigation and announcement, so perhaps the commands can be done together or separated. The example given had navigate first and then speak for the announcement. So maybe the response should include a navigation command followed by an announcements action if applicable.

But looking at the supported edge cases, I think it might not handle announcements as a separate function. Maybe I need to split them into two commands: one for navigating and another for announcing.

So in the response, after the user naviges to C&D - Hot Food Area, they can then ""announce"" that area when they land there. However, since announcements are part of the supported edge cases, perhaps it's better to have separate actions.

But I'm not sure if the system supports multiple actions at once or needs them separately. The user mentioned commands sequentially, so maybe both should be included in the actions list but as separate speak actions.

Alternatively, maybe just navigate and then announce with a different command, like speak again for the announcement.

So, putting it together: navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area clearly and then ""announce"" that area when they are there. But I'm not entirely sure how announcements are handled in terms of actions. In the example given later, they had ""announce"" as part of a single command, but perhaps it's better to handle them separately.

In any case, following the rules, I think I should include both actions: navigate and announce. So the response would have two speak commands or maybe separate functions based on how the system is designed.

But since the user only asked for navigating and then announcing where they landed, I'll structure it accordingly.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's query. Let me break it down step by step.

The user wrote: ""Robot, go to Silent Study and say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice."" Hmm, that sounds like they want the robot to navigate to the ""Silent Study"" zone and say that specific text. 

First, I need to parse this query. The keywords here are ""Robot,"" ""go to,"" and ""say."" Looking at the available waypoints, there's a ""Sgt, go to Silent Study"" waypoint. Wait, but the query is about saying ""Silent Study"" instead of ""gop to.""

I should check if the keyword matching includes just the command part. So, the query doesn't mention moving around or using the robot as a guide; it's purely about making a statement. That means I might not be able to match this directly because the waypoint requires guiding or navigating.

Looking at the options, I see that if there are no waypoints that fit the keyword criteria related to just saying ""Silent Study,"" then it should output an error response. In this case, since the query is about making a statement and not navigating around a specific zone, I think there's no matching waypoint available.

So, my next step is to follow the rules provided. Ignore extra tokens first. The user didn't have any prefixes like ""E7 ideas clinic,"" so that's fine. Now, check if the cleaned input contains any keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint.

The query doesn't mention any of those; it's just making an assertion. Therefore, I need to output an error action where the user says, ""This waypoint does not exist."" That covers the case where there are no valid waypoints matching the keyword criteria.
</think>

```json
{
    ""actions"": [
        {
            ""action"": ""speak"",
            ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
        }
    ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,[],,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

First, I need to understand the available waypoints and their keywords. Looking back at the info provided, I see that each waypoint has a name and some associated keywords. For example, ""RoboHub Entrance"" has keywords like "" navigate"", ""wait"", etc.

The user's request is to move to the ""Assembly Room"" upon arrival. So I need to check if there's a waypoint named exactly ""Assembly Room"". Scanning through each available waypoint:

- There are places like Car Park B, Bus Station, SDC Vehicle, truck, RAV4, and other parking lots.
- Then there's the Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic.
- I don't see ""Assembly Room"" as one of the names. So it seems that the user might have a typo or doesn't recognize this specific room.

Since none of the waypoints are exactly named ""Assembly Room"", the system needs to determine if any keywords match. Looking at the keywords for each waypoint, like ""move"", ""navigate"", ""wait"", etc., but since there's no direct keyword matching for ""Assembly Room"" in any of the provided waypoints, this becomes tricky.

The rules say that if extra tokens are ignored and none of the keywords match the remaining input or the waypoint names, then output an error. The user's query is a literal request to go to ""Assembly Room"", which doesn't exist as a waypoint name.

So, I should inform the user that there's no such waypoint and suggest moving to other nearby areas. This way, the user knows exactly where to look next or gets a clear message about what can be done without ambiguity.
</think>

Here’s my understanding of your request:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Ignore Extra Tokens:** The input is ""Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival."" Ignoring extra tokens doesn’t change this.

2. **Keyword Matching:** There are no waypoints named ""Assembly Room"". Let’s look at the keywords associated with each waypoint:
   - Car Park B
   - Bus Station
   - SDC Vehicle
   - Truck
   - RAV4 (which includes a vehicle, probably a truck)
   - Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic

3. **Strict Match Requirement:** Since none of the keywords match ""Assembly Room"", and multiple waypoint names exist, we have to consider which one is closest or most relevant.

4. **Handling Complex Commands:** The command isn’t just about navigating; it also mentions moving to a specific room and state it there upon arrival. This implies that the system should guide the user to this room.

5. **Conclusion:** Since ""Assembly Room"" doesn't exist as a waypoint name, and no nearby waypoint is available (other than other parking lots and a truck room), I cannot perform the requested action. I need to inform the user that there's no such waypoint and suggest moving to nearby areas or requesting more specific directions.

**Error Response:**

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want to go to ""the Forumla Electric Baja Design Team."" First, I need to understand what that means. The word ""Formula"" is a bit unusual in context, so maybe it's a typo or a specific term they're using.

Looking at the available waypoints, none seem to directly mention ""Formula,"" ""Electric,"" or ""Baja."" So, I should consider if ""Design Team"" is part of any waypoint. The waypoint named ""Design Team"" has keywords like [""design"", ""team""], which might be relevant.

The user probably wants to navigate to a specific location related to the Design Team via Formula. Given that none of the other waypoints mention ""Formula,"" it's safe to assume they want to go to where the Design Team is located, using ""Navigate"" to get there from an assumed starting point.

I should check if ""Design Team"" is one of the available waypoint names and see how it's spelled in keywords. Since it's present with [""design"", ""team""], it fits the keyword criteria. Therefore, the response should instruct navigation towards the Design Team's location, assuming the exact coordinates are known or ignoring extra tokens.

I also need to ensure that if there's an ambiguity, I choose the most likely one, which in this case seems like following the waypoint's name and function. So, my final action is to navigate with the provided coordinates.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's query. The query they provided is: ""Robot, proceed to Elevators and say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation.""

First, I need to parse the input string and identify any waypoints or keywords that match the available options. Let's break it down step by step.

The query starts with ""Robot,"" which seems like a keyword related to movement. Following that, they mention proceeding to Elevators. The word ""Elevators"" is also included in their request. Now, looking at the available waypoints and their keywords:

1. E7 ideas clinic: Keywords are [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""]
2. E7 ideas project 3: Keywords are [""ideas"", ""project"", ""space""]
3. Elevators: Keywords include ""elevators"" which is exactly what they're asking for.
4. Ideas clinic: Keywords are [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""]

Now, the query includes ""Elevators,"" which matches the keyword for the Elevator waypoint. The word ""Robot"" might refer to a function or another waypoint. Wait, in the available waypoints, there's no Robot mentioned yet. Let me check if any other waypoint is associated with ""Robot."" Looking back, I see that the third waypoint is simply ""Elevators,"" so perhaps ""Robot"" isn't part of any valid waypoint.

So, the input includes ""Elevators,"" which points directly to the Elevator waypoint. The word ""Robot"" might not be recognized as a keyword for any existing waypoint, so it's ignored or considered irrelevant here.

Putting this together, the user is asking to proceed to Elevators and say ""Elevators."" This suggests they want to navigate via Elevators, which is covered under the Elevator waypoint. Therefore, the action should be to navigate using the Elevators section of the Elevator waypoint.

I also need to ensure that I'm following the rules provided. The input includes a keyword (""Elevators"") and the necessary context or description (since it's about navigating), so it should match one of the waypoints without ambiguity. There's no conflict here, so it should be handled by the system as per the guidelines.

In summary, the query is asking to navigate using Elevators, which corresponds to the Elevator waypoint. The action will involve navigating through the Elevator section.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's query using the given rules and keyword-based waypoints. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the user's query is ""Can you take me to the UWFE bay please."" The key keywords here are ""UWFE"" and the location within the waypoint. From the context, I remember that each waypoint has a name and some associated keywords or words. 

Looking back at the provided information, there's a waypoint called ""Uwfe Ideas Clinic"". Its keywords include [""u w f e ideas clinic""], which includes the number 'u w f e'—but wait, the user used ""UWFE"", not ""u w f e"". Hmm, that might be a typo. 

I should check if any other waypoints mention ""UWFE"". Scanning through, I don't see another one with ""UWFE"" except this one. So, ""Uwfe Ideas Clinic"" is the only relevant waypoint here.

Now, following the rules: ignore extra tokens. The query starts with a capital 'U' and a number in ""UWFE"", so I'll consider that as part of the waypoint name. 

Next, keyword matching. The keywords associated with ""Uwfe Ideas Clinic"" are [""u w f e ideas clinic""]. Wait, does this include 'UWFE'? No, it's just ""u w f e"". So it doesn't match exactly because it has a different sequence of letters or includes extra characters.

Since the query uses ""UWFE"", which is four uppercase letters without any diacritics or numbers in between, and the waypoint keyword starts with 'u' followed by other lowercase letters, it's not matching. That means the input doesn't include the keywords expected for this waypoint.

Additionally, I should check if there are any other waypoints that might match. The available ones don't mention ""UWFE"" except this one, so no other options seem possible.

Therefore, based on rule 3, since extra tokens are ignored and the remaining text doesn't include the required keywords or words of the waypoint name, I need to output an error response saying the specified waypoint does not exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query using the provided waypoint system. The user said, ""Can you take me to the WFE bay please."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that each waypoint has keywords associated with them. For a given keyword input, it should match exactly one of these keywords. So, let me look at all the available waypoints and their corresponding keywords.

Looking through the list:

- E7 ideas clinic
- F8 906
- B7 345
- G8 123
- H8 567
- I7 987
- J7 701
- K7 609
- L7 709
- M7 113
- N6 439
- O8 808
- O9 456
- P8 257
- R8 890
- S8 645
- T8 584
- U8 307
- V8 162
- W8 542
- W8 356
- X7 879
- Y8 492
- Z8 299

Each of these has a set of keywords. The user just provided ""WFE bay."" I need to check if this corresponds to any keyword in the list.

Wait, let me look at the description. The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So, each waypoint is associated with some keywords that must be met. For example, WFE bay might have keywords like ""WFE"" or other related terms. But I'm not seeing a direct match for ""WFE bay.""

Looking through each waypoint:

- W8 542: Keywords include ""wayside."" So, does WFE correspond to ""wayside""? Maybe it's a different area.
- W8 356: Same as above; still ""wayside.""
- I7 987: Doesn't seem related to WFE.

I notice that some waypoints have similar names but aren't directly connected. For instance, E7 ideas clinic is under E7, but it doesn't relate to WFE. Similarly, F8 345 isn't directly relevant either.

So, since ""WFE bay"" doesn't match any of the keywords in the available waypoints, I need to check if that's an issue. The rules say to ignore extra tokens and look for exact matches. But here, the input is just ""WFE bay,"" which doesn't have a direct keyword from any waypoint.

Wait, maybe ""WFE"" isn't a keyword in the list provided? Let me double-check the keywords from the user prompt. No, I don't see ""WFE"" listed as a keyword anywhere. That means there's no way to match this input with any of the available waypoints based on their defined keywords.

Therefore, according to rule 3, if extra tokens are ignored and the remaining text doesn't include any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for any given waypoint, then it's an invalid request. So, since ""WFE bay"" can't be matched with any keyword from the provided waypoints, this is a problem.

The response should be that this waypoint does not exist, and I need to provide a speak action explaining the issue.

  ""actions"": [

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to help with the user's query: ""Can you take me to the FE bay please."" Let me break this down.

First, looking at the prompt provided. The user wants to navigate from the starting location (0,0) to the FE Bay. FE Bay is one of the waypoints mentioned earlier. 

Wait, I should check if FE Bay exists among the available waypoints. Scanning through the list: starting from 'E7 ideas clinic' up to 'RAV4'. I don't see FE Bay listed yet. So that means the input doesn't match any known waypoint.

That's a problem because according to the rules, each command must be matched with one of the waypoints. Since FE Bay isn't available, there's no valid way to fulfill this request.

So, the response should mention that the waypoint does not exist. I'll need to follow the structured approach: ignoring extra tokens, checking keywords and names, and ensuring a clear action is taken.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

# Examples
Example Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?

Okay, let's break down the user's query. They want to go to ""Formula bay"". I need to figure out if this is a recognized waypoint.

Hmm, it seems Formula bay isn't listed. That means when ignoring extra tokens, since nothing matches, we have to respond that this waypoint doesn't exist.

I should also consider if any part of the query could be parsed as another keyword. The words ""Formula"" and ""bay"" don't fit into the defined keywords for any waypoints. Therefore, it's clear that Formula bay isn't an existing option.

So, my response will follow the instructions by outputting a spoken action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query using the given waypoints and commands. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user asked, ""Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?"". Hmm, looking at the available waypoints, there isn't one explicitly named Mars Rover. The closest is ""Mars Science Lab"" with a specific coordinates, but that's not exactly Mars Rover itself. So, I need to see if any waypoint matches the idea of a Mars Rover-related area.

Looking through the list, I don't find any waypoint related to Mars or Mars Rover. The available keywords and waypoints include rooms in different areas like E7 ideas clinic, C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but not Mars related ones. Since there's no direct matching waypoint for ""Mars Rover"" or ""Mars Science Lab"", I have to respond that this is an invalid request.

According to the rules, if none of the waypoints match, we should output a specific action. In this case, the response needs to state that this is not a valid waypoint and ask the user to clarify. So my actions will include speaking with a clear error message asking for more details.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down the user's query. They want to go to a car design team. From the provided waypoints, I see there's one defined as ""Car Design Team"" with the coordinates ""C&D - Car Design Area"". 

First, I'll check if this waypoint is recognized by using the keyword matching rules. The input starts without extra tokens, so it remains ""Car Design Team"". Since it contains the core identifier ""Car"", it should match.

Next, I need to ensure that after ignoring any prefixes like ""C&D"", which we've already handled, there are no additional keywords or words from the waypoint name. The only relevant part is ""Team"", but since Car Design Team doesn't have a keyword for team in the available list (as per the examples), it's acceptable.

There's no ambiguity here because it clearly references the Car Design Team waypoint. No extra actions beyond navigation are needed, and it fits into the supported commands.

So, the response should guide them to navigate to ""C&D - Car Design Area"" where they can meet Zach for assistance.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the user wants ""Can you take me to the car design team?"". My task is to translate this into a command using the supported keywords and functions.

Looking at the available waypoints, each has specific names and keywords. For instance, ""Car Design"" can be translated as ""car design"" or ""car design room"". So, the query mentions ""take me to the car design team"", which translates to ""pick up my lunch from the car design area"".

Now, I'll check if ""car design"" is one of the waypoint names. Scanning through the list, yes, there's a waypoint named ""Car Design - Car Area"". This means the keywords include ""car"", ""design"", and ""area"". The query mentions ""take me to the car design team"", which is exactly what the Car Design area does.

So, I'll need to navigate to the car design room. That's two actions: first, pick up my lunch from there, then wait for the person. Since it's a simple request without any extra tokens or ambiguous options, no speak action is needed except if something goes wrong, but in this case, everything seems clear.

I think that covers all the necessary steps and ensures the response is accurate based on the provided waypoints.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's query: ""Take me to the washroom."" Let me start by understanding the rules and guidelines provided.

First, the user has given a set of waypoints with their corresponding keywords. Each waypoint is defined as an object that includes an identifier (like 'ideas clinic') and some associated terms or features (like 'clinic'). The task is to determine if there's a matching waypoint based on the query.

The query is ""Take me to the washroom."" I need to see if any of the available waypoints include the term ""washroom"" in their keywords. Looking back at the provided data, each waypoint has specific keywords:

1. washroom: {""name"": ""$Washroom"", ""words"": [""washroom""]}
2. ideas clinic: {""name"": ""ideas Clinic"", ""words"": [""ideas"", ""clinic""]}

So the query is about taking someone to the Washroom. Checking the available waypoints, only Washroom has the keyword 'washroom'. The 'ideas' keyword might refer to a different area or feature, but in this case, since it's not present in any waypoint, it can't be used.

Now, I need to follow the rules for handling such queries. The first step is ignoring extra tokens and checking if the input starts with any alphanumeric codes or prefixes. In this case, there are no extra tokens at the beginning of ""Take me to the washroom."" So we proceed.

Next, keyword matching: After ignoring extra tokens, does the remaining text contain any of the keywords for a valid waypoint? For Washroom, it contains 'washroom', which matches one of the waypoints. Since another waypoint is based on 'ideas', but there's no mention of an Ideas area in the query, Washroom seems like the only valid option.

Since there's at least one matching keyword (washroom) for Washroom, the request can proceed without ambiguity. There isn't an extra action required because the necessary information is present to navigate to the Washroom.

Therefore, the appropriate actions are to navigate to the Washroom.
</think>

The query ""Take me to the washroom"" matches the waypoint ""washroom,"" which is defined as {""name"": ""$Washroom"", ""words"": [""washroom""]}. 

**actions:**
```json

    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's instruction. The user says, ""Take me to the bathroom."" First, I should identify which waypoints are available and their corresponding keywords.

Looking through the list, there's a waypoint called ""Take Me to the Bathroom"" with the name ""Bathroom"". So, that's one keyword: ""bathroom"". Also, it includes the words ""take"", ""me"", ""to"", and ""the"".

Next, I need to consider if there are other keywords or related terms. The user is asking for a bathroom, so I should check all available waypoints.

Wait, let me list out the key points:

1. Ignore extra tokens: The input doesn't have any prefixes like ""E7 ideas clinic"" or any other code, so it's straightforward.

2. Keyword matching: The waypoint ""Bathroom"" has keywords [""bathroom"", ""take"", ""me"", ""to""], which include exactly what the user is asking for. So that fits perfectly.

3. Strict match requirement: Since the cleaned input contains all necessary keywords and points directly to a single valid waypoint, there's no ambiguity here. It doesn't seem like multiple waypoints would fit because the bathroom keyword is unique in this list.

4. Handling complex commands: The user didn't request any functions beyond navigation or speaking; they just want to navigate to the bathroom. So I don't need to list additional actions beyond what's required.

5. Examples show that for a simple command like asking for something, the system navigates and speaks accordingly. Similarly, requesting help would be handled by wait or speak commands.

So, putting it all together, the response should guide the user to navigate to the bathroom and ask if they need assistance. That makes sense because each step is clearly outlined.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. The user wants me to ""take me to the Formula Electric Waterloop design team."" Hmm, that sounds like they're looking for a specific way to navigate their location.

First, let me break down what they're asking. They want to go to a waypoint labeled ""Formula Electric Waterloop design team,"" but I'm not sure how this translates into actual coordinates or keywords. Wait, maybe the keyword part is more straightforward. The waypoint name includes ""waterloop"" and ""design team."" So perhaps I need to look for any waypoints that mention these terms.

Looking at the available waypoints, I see there are entries like ""RoboHub,"" ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" and others. None of them seem directly related to Formula Electric Waterloop. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Alternatively, could ""waterloop"" be a keyword? Or perhaps it's part of the waypoint name that needs to be extracted?

Wait, another thought: maybe the user meant ""Formula Electric Waterloop Design Team."" That would include all three components—formula, electric, and waterloop design team. But I don't see any waypoint named that way. The closest is ""Waterloop"" as a keyword.

Looking back at the available keywords for each waypoint, ""waterloop"" appears in both ""RoboHub"" and ""Waterloop."" So if the user meant to go to a place where ""waterloop"" is referenced, they might be referring to either RoboHub or Waterloop. But since it's singular in their query (""Formula Electric Waterloop Design Team""), maybe it's specifically waterloop design team.

But wait, none of the waypoints have both ""formula,"" ""electric,"" and ""waterloop."" So I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should check if any waypoint mentions ""Waterloop"" as part of its name or keyword. Yes, in RoboHub, the keywords include [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], but that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps they meant to go to the Waterloop waypoint, which is just one entry with keyword ""waterloop."" But since their query specifies both ""formula"" and ""electric,"" maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding on their part. They might have intended to use a different term, like ""RoboHub"" for their request.

Wait, if I proceed under the assumption that they meant to go to RoboHub because of the keywords provided in their query, but RoboHub doesn't directly refer to formula electric waterloop. So maybe it's not possible to identify such a waypoint based on the given keywords.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to navigate by using ""waterloop"" as part of their journey. Since none of the waypoints mention both ""formula,"" ""electric,"" and ""waterloop,"" I might need to respond that this request doesn't exist or is invalid because there's no way to identify such a waypoint based on the given keywords.

Wait, but looking back at the available waypoints, I see entries like ""RoboHub"" with specific coordinates. Maybe the user wants to navigate directly to RoboHub by specifying its location. Since RoboHub has the name ""RoboHub Entrance"" and coordinates (25, 50), perhaps that's what they need.

But their query is about ""Formula Electric Waterloop design team,"" which isn't in the waypoints. So unless I'm missing something, it seems like this request doesn't correspond to any valid waypoint based on the given keywords and available entries.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's try to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The query is ""Take me to the restroom."" Okay, so the user wants me to navigate to the restroom. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to ignore any extra tokens at the beginning of the input. In this case, there are none, so that part isn't an issue. Next, I have to identify the relevant waypoint based on keywords. The query mentions ""rubbish,"" which is a play on ""rubbish"" being a type of bathroom or restroom.

Looking through the available waypoints, I see one defined as ""Rubbish."" Its description includes words like ""rubbish,"" ""flushable,"" and ""flushing."" This seems to fit perfectly because the user is asking about taking someone to the restroom, which aligns with the functionality of a ""Rubbish"" waypoint.

Now, I'll check if there are any extra tokens or if the input matches any keyword. The query doesn't have any extra tokens, and it's directly referencing the words in the waypoint name. So, it seems like this is a valid reference.

Since there's no ambiguity here—each part of the request is clear and fits exactly with the provided waypoints—the response should just be a ""navigate"" action to the correct restroom location.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to process their query and provide a response based on predefined waypoints and commands. First, I need to understand the query they've given: ""Go to the Formula Electric Electrical bay, then the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja."" 

Hmm, that's a bit of a convoluted instruction. I should break it down step by step. The user is asking for multiple waypoints and specific actions, including waiting time. So, each step in their query corresponds to moving the cursor through these waypoints.

Wait, but there are some things I need to consider. Each waypoint has certain keywords that define it. For example, ""Formula Electric Electrical bay"" probably includes ""Formula Electric"" as a keyword. The user's instruction mentions going through several bays and then waiting 5 minutes before returning to the last one, which is the Baja.

I should check if each mentioned bay is correctly defined in the list provided. Let me look back at the waypoints:

- Formula Electric Ideas clinic
- Formula Electric Mech Bay
- Formula Electric Electrical bay
- Formula Electric RoboHub
- Formula Electric Rocketry
- Formula Electric Baja

Wait, hold on. The user's query mentions ""Formula Electric Electrical bay"" and then ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"". Looking back, the available waypoints have ""Mech Bay"", so ""Formula Electric Mechanical Bay"" is defined as one of them. But in the user's instruction, it's called ""Electrical Bay."" That might be an issue because I don't see a waypoint with that exact name.

Additionally, after mentioning each bay, the user goes to ""Midnight Sun"". Is there a definedwaypoint for Midnight Sun? Scanning through the list again: No, midnight sun is not present. So perhaps this is why it's flagged as invalid since there's no such waypoint.

But wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The user wrote ""Formula Electric Electrical bay"" and then goes to ""Mech Bay"", which seems correct because ""Mech Bay"" is defined as one of them. But when they mention ""Electrical"", perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding in the query. Maybe they meant ""Mech"" instead of ""Electical""? Or maybe I should proceed with what's given.

Also, after going through all the bays and mentioning Midnight Sun, which isn't listed, that might cause confusion. But since the user is listing steps, perhaps it's necessary to include that in their response despite the missing waypoint.

Another thing is the waiting time of 5 minutes. I need to make sure if this action is supported. The allowed actions are navigate, speak, and wait. So adding ""wait"" seems correct, but the specific duration needs confirmation.

Putting it all together, my response should outline each step with their respective waypoints and keywords. However, since there's no exact waypoint for Midnight Sun as per the given list, I might need to clarify that or assume that it's an error condition if I proceed without a defined waypoint there.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's request. Let me start by breaking down what they're asking for.

The user wants to navigate through a series of waypoints: Formula Electric Electrical Bay, Formula Electric Mech Bay, Baja, Midnight Sun, and then back to the Baja. After that, they want to wait 5 minutes and return to the Baja.

First, I should check if there's an available waypoint that matches all these requests. Looking at the available waypoints, the only one that mentions ""Baja"" is Formula Electric Baja. So any other waypoint doesn't include ""Baja"".

Next, I need to see if the user is asking for more than just the points of interest. They're not specifying how they'll move between the places or waiting time. The requests are too vague for a clear response.

I remember that according to the guidelines, if I can't identify the waypoints and don't have enough details about the request, I should respond by saying it doesn't exist. That's what this seems like because the user is trying to plan a route but isn't providing specific movement or waiting times beyond their initial understanding of the points.

So, putting it all together, I think the best course of action is to explain that there are no waypoint definitions matching the request and that additional information isn't available. This way, the user knows exactly what they're dealing with.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to help this user with their request. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user provided a query: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja."" That seems like multiple waypoints in a row and ending back at a specific place. 

Looking at the available waypoints from the given code, I don't see ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" listed as an option. The closest one is ""Formula E ideas clinic"", but that doesn't match because it's not exactly the same word. There are other waypoint names like ""E7 ideas clinic"", ""C&D Coffee Area"", etc., but none of them include ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"". 

I also need to consider the rules provided. The user has to ignore extra tokens and check if the cleaned input matches any keyword or the words in the waypoint name. Since there's no such waypoint, this becomes invalid.

Additionally, according to point 3, if a waypoint is only valid if it clearly points to one single waypoint and doesn't require ambiguity, then this would be an issue. Here, without a matching waypoint, it's impossible to process the request accurately. 

So, the response should mention that the user hasn't specified any waypoints but has given multiple requests in sequence. It also needs to indicate that there's no valid way to handle this request because of the missing waypoint information.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down the user's query step by step. The query is: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.""

First, I need to understand what each waypoint represents and how they are connected based on their coordinates.

1. **Formula Electric Mech Bay**: This is listed under ""FSAE"". From the data, it's at (250, 30). So that's one point.
2. **Baja**: Under ""Best"", with a coordinate of (148, 96).
3. **Rocketry**: Under ""Rocketry"", which is also under ""FSAE"" but I need to check the exact coordinates for Rocketry. Wait, looking back, I think Rocketry might be listed separately or perhaps it's another FSAE. Hmm, maybe I should verify that.

Wait, actually, in the given data, the available waypoints are:

- E7 ideas clinic
- E7 buildings
- E7 roads
- E7 ideas day
- Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)
- Baja
- Rocketry

Each with specific coordinates. Let me check each one:

- **E7 ideas clinic**: No coordinates provided.
- **E7 buildings**: Not a waypoint, just a building name.
- **E7 roads**: Not a waypoint.
- **E7 ideas day**: Not a waypoint.
- **Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)**: Coordinates (250, 30)
- **Baja**: Coordinates (148, 96)
- **Rocketry**: I'm not sure about the coordinates. It might be listed under FSAE or as a separate waypoint.

Wait, looking back at the available waypoints provided:

They are:

1. E7 ideas clinic
2. E7 buildings
3. E7 roads
4. E7 ideas day
5. Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)
6. Baja
7. Rocketry

Each of these has specific coordinates, except perhaps Rocketry. Let me check.

Looking at the data provided:

- **E7 ideas clinic**: No coordinates.
- **E7 buildings**: Not a waypoint.
- **E7 roads**: Not a waypoint.
- **E7 ideas day**: Not a waypoint.
- **FEMB**: (250, 30)
- **Baja**: (148, 96)
- **Rocketry**: I think Rocketry is under ""Rocketry"" which has coordinates (-20, -21). Wait, no, looking back at the data provided, it's actually listed as:

Wait, in the data provided, each waypoint is like:

""E7 ideas day"" with (x,y)=(44,1), and ""FEMB"" is (250,30).

But for Rocketry, I don't see its coordinates. It might be listed under a different waypoint or perhaps it's an extra keyword. Wait, looking back at the data:

The available waypoints are:

- E7 ideas day: (44,1)
- FEMB: (250,30)
- Baja: (148,96)

And others like ""E7 buildings"" and ""E7 roads"". Maybe Rocketry is under another category or has coordinates. Wait, actually, the user included:

""Rocketry"":

1. E7 Road 1
2. E7 Road 2
3. E7 Ideas Day
4. FEMB
5. Baja
6. Rocketry

Wait, no, looking back at the provided data:

The available waypoints after ""E7 ideas day"" are:

""E7 buildings"" - No coordinates.
""E7 roads"" - No coordinates.
""E7 ideas day"" - (44,1)
""FEMB"" - (250,30)
""Baja"" - (148,96)
""Rocketry"":

1. E7 Road 1
2. E7 Road 2
3. E7 Ideas Day
4. FEMB
5. Baja
6. Rocketry

Wait, perhaps ""Rocketry"" is under a different waypoint. Alternatively, maybe it's listed as another waypoint with coordinates.

But looking at the data, each available waypoint has its own set of coordinates:

- Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB) is at (250,30)
- Baja is at (148,96)
- Rocketry: Is there a coordinate for Rocketry? It's unclear. Maybe it's not listed as a waypoint but part of another group.

Wait, looking back, the user's query is about going to Formula Electric Mech Bay, then Baja, then Rocketry, then Midnight Sun, and waiting 5 minutes. So let's map each step to their coordinates:

1. **Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)**: (250,30)
2. **Baja**: (148,96)
3. **Rocketry**: Need to find its coordinates.

Wait, looking at the data provided, under ""E7 Road 1"", there are some coordinates:

- E7 Road 1: Coordinates (-34, -15), (-30, -21), (36, -9). So Rocketry might be listed here? Or is it a different waypoint.

Wait, the available waypoints are:

""E7 buildings"" - No coords
""E7 roads"" - No coords
""E7 ideas day"" - (44,1)
""FEMB"" - (250,30)
""Baja"" - (148,96)
*Rocketry*: E7 Road 1, E7 Road 2, E7 Ideas Day, FEMB, Baja, Rocketry. Wait, maybe Rocketry is under a different waypoint with specific coordinates.

Wait, looking at the data provided:

- ""Rocketry"" has its own set of coordinates, but it's not listed as a separate waypoint in the given data. So perhaps each time we go to Rocketry, we need to see if there are coordinates for that specific instance.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's list all the waypoints with their coordinates:

1. E7 ideas day: (44,1)
2. FEMB: (250,30)
3. Baja: (148,96)
4. Rocketry: Let's assume it has its own set of coordinates, but I don't see them listed here.

Wait, perhaps each ""Rocketry"" instance is under a different waypoint with specific coordinates. So for each step to Rocketry, we need to see what that coordinate is.

But in the given data, only FEMB and Baja are specified. The other options like E7 Road 1 have multiple coordinates. Maybe I should consider that each ""Rocketry"" instance has its own set of coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo or misrepresentation, but based on the provided data, I'll proceed with the given coordinates.

So, the steps are:

- Go to FEMB at (250,30)
- Then to Baja at (148,96)
- Then Rocketry. But where is its coordinate? It's unclear from the data. Maybe each ""Rocketry"" instance has a specific point.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again:

Looking back, the available waypoints are:

""E7 buildings""

""E7 roads""

""E7 ideas day"": (44,1)

""FEMB"": (250,30)

""Baja"": (148,96)

And then ""Rocketry"" is a waypoint under ""E7 Road 1"":

-E7 Road 1: (-34,-15), (-30,-21), (36,-9)
-E7 Road 2: Let's assume it has its own coordinates
-E7 Ideas Day: (44,1) - but that's the same as E7 ideas day.
-FEMB: (250,30) - which is FEMB.

So perhaps Rocketry has coordinates like (-34,-15), etc., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant E7 Road 2 or another waypoint.

But based on the data provided, I'll proceed with the given coordinates.

So, after Baja at (148,96):

- Next is Rocketry. If each ""Rocketry"" instance has its own coordinate, we need to see what that is. But it's unclear from the given data. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing them and forgot one of the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the waypoints with their coordinates:

1. E7 ideas day: (44,1)
2. FEMB: (250,30)
3. Baja: (148,96)

Assuming Rocketry is under a different waypoint with specific coordinates, perhaps it's not listed here.

But in the user's query, after FEMB, they go to Baja, then Rocketry, and then midnight sun.

So, if FEMB is at (250,30), Baja at (148,96), and then Rocketry needs its coordinate. If I can't find it here, maybe the user made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps each ""Rocketry"" instance has a different coordinate. Let's say:

-E7 Road 1: (-34,-15)
-E7 Road 2: (some other coords)
But without knowing the exact coordinates for Rocketry, I can't map it precisely.

Wait, perhaps the user meant that the next step after Baja is to Rocketry's own specific coordinate. But since we don't have that data here, maybe the answer should include a note that the coordinate isn't provided or requires further information.

Alternatively, if each ""Rocketry"" instance has a set of coordinates, then:

-E7 Road 1: (-34,-15), (some other coords)
-Baja is at (148,96), so perhaps Rocketry after Baja would be on one of the E7 Road instances.

But without knowing the exact positions for each ""Rocketry"" instance, it's difficult to map this correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume that each time you go to Rocketry, it's at (-34,-15). But I don't know if that's correct based on the data provided.

I think the best approach is to list all the coordinates:

- E7 ideas day: (44,1)
- FEMB: (250,30)
- Baja: (148,96)

Assuming Rocketry has its own coordinate(s), perhaps it's not provided in the given data. Therefore, based on the information given, I can only map up to FEMB and Baja.

So, summarizing:

- Start at E7 ideas day (44,1)
- Then go to FEMB at (250,30)
- Then to Baja at (148,96)

After that, the user would need to know where Rocketry is located, which isn't provided in this data set.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe after FEMB, they go to Baja, then to a different ""Rocketry"" instance somewhere else with specific coordinates, but without knowing those, it's hard to map.

Given the information, I think the answer is that you follow E7 ideas day (44,1), then to FEMB at (250,30), and then to Baja at (148,96). After that, if Rocketry is a separate instance, you would need its coordinate.

But since I don't have those coordinates here, perhaps the answer should note that rocketry's position isn't specified in this dataset.
</think>

To follow the steps described:

1. Begin at **E7 ideas day** located at the coordinates (44, 1).
2. Proceed to **Fermi-Effective Field Theory (FEMB)** located at the coordinates (250, 30).
3. Finally, visit **Baja** situated at the coordinates (148, 96).

After these points, if Rocketry is a separate instance, you would need its specific coordinate information to be determined.

Final Answer:
- E7 ideas day: \boxed{(44, 1)}
- FEMB: \boxed{(250, 30)}
- Baja: \boxed{(148, 96)}","{(44, 1)}- FEMB: \boxed{(250, 30)}- Baja: \boxed{(148, 96)}",0.0,0.0,"['UWFE - Electrical Bay', 'UWFE - Mech Bay', 'Baja', 'Rocketry', 'Midnight Sun', ('wait, 5, 'minutes')]",Nav,XRIF response is Invalid

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to navigate through several waypoints and wait for a while before each one. They mentioned going from ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" to ""Baja"", then ""Rocketry"", and finally ""Midnight Sun"". 

First, I need to identify each waypoint's keywords. Formula Electric Mech Bay has keywords like ""Formula"", ""Electric"", ""Mech Bay"". Baja is about motorsports, so it might have terms related to racing. Rocketry usually involves rockets, so maybe that's a keyword. Midnight Sun could be related to solar systems or something else.

I check the available waypoints: E7 ideas clinic (ignore extra tokens), navigate, speak, wait. None of these have ""Formula"", ""Electric"", or ""Mech Bay"". Baja doesn't appear in any waypoint name. Rocketry isn't a keyword for any listed waypoint. Midnight Sun is also not mentioned.

Since none of the waypoints match the user's request, I should respond that it's invalid. But wait, there are extra tokens like ""Baja"" and ""Rocketry"" before the actual command. Ignoring those, the input left me without applicable keywords or waypoints.

So, my response must inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. Also, I have to include an action for speaking as per the rules.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': ""Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint""}]}",0.0,0.0,"['UWFE - Electrical Bay', 'UWFE - Mech Bay', 'Baja', 'Rocketry', 'Midnight Sun']",Nav,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request for ""Go to Baja and tell them to give Zach his powerdrill back."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what kind of task is being asked. The user wants someone to go to a location called Baja and instruct someone else (Zach) to retrieve a tool from there. It sounds like it's related to navigating a specific area but includes an instruction to Zach. 

Looking at the available waypoints, I need to see if ""Baja"" is one of them. Scanning through the list provided, I don't see any waypoint that mentions Baja or any activity involving Baja. The keywords are things like ideas clinic, C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but not Baja.

So, since ""Go to Baja and tell them..."" is a request to navigate but includes an instruction to Zach, which isn't present in the provided waypoints, I think this is invalid. The system needs to recognize that there's no valid waypoint for navigating to Baja.

Next, following the rules, when extra tokens are ignored, I don't see any additional tokens here. So the cleaned input is just ""Go to Baja and tell them..."" which isn't a recognized keyword or part of any waypoint name.

In such cases, the system should output an error response indicating that this waypoint doesn't exist. It's not one of the predefined options like ideas clinic, C&D areas, etc., so it falls under the invalid waypoints category.

Putting it all together, I need to ensure that the speaking action is ""speak"" and input the reason clearly. That should handle the scenario properly.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down this user's query. The user wants to go to Rocketry and wait for 5 minutes. 

First, I need to parse the command ""go to Rocketry wait for 5 minutes"". The key words here are ""Rocketry"", which directly refers to a waypoint called Rocketry. So, that should be straightforward.

Looking at the available waypoints, Rocketry is mentioned as ""R03 ideas clinic"". So, the keywords would include ""rocketry"", ""r03"", and ""ideas"". 

The user's input starts with ""Go to Rocketry wait for 5 minutes"" after ignoring any extra tokens. Ignoring anything before ""Rocketry"", the cleaned text is just ""Rocketry"". Now, I check if this contains any of the keywords. The name ""R03 ideas clinic"" includes ""rocketry""? Wait, no. It's ""r03 ideas"". So, it doesn't include ""rocketry"".

Hmm, that might be a problem because ""R03 ideas"" is part of the waypoint's name but not the keyword itself. That means the input ""R03 ideas clinic"" includes ""r03"", which is part of the name, but not ""rocketry"". So, it doesn't match any of the available waypoints.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The waypoint named R03 ideas clinic has keywords like [""r03"", ""ideas"", ""clinic""]. So, the input ""R03 ideas"" would include ""r03"", which is a keyword for that waypoint. But wait, in the command, it's ""Rocketry"". Does ""R03 ideas"" have any connection to Rocketry? Not unless ""R03 ideas"" refers to Rocketry, but from context, R03 ideas isn't associated with Rocketry.

So, since ""R03 ideas clinic"" doesn't include ""rocketry"" in its keywords or the input text after ignoring extra tokens, it's invalid. The user is asking for a waypoint that isn't recognized, so this should trigger an error response.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query using the provided guidelines. The user said, ""Go to the wash bay and tell them to get out."" Let me break this down.

First, looking at the task, it seems like the user wants the system to follow specific commands and actions based on predefined rules. I remember that each waypoint has keywords, and the system must match these keywords in a case-insensitive way after ignoring extra tokens.

The first thing I should do is parse the user's query. It says ""Go to the wash bay."" Now, I need to see if there's a corresponding waypoint for ""wash bay."" Scanning through the available waypoints, none mention ""wash"" or ""bay,"" so this doesn't directly match any existing waypoint.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the list again. The user prompt lists several waypoints like E7 ideas clinic and others with specific locations. There's a waypoint called ""Wash Bay"" but it's not in the options provided here—it might be part of the available ones. Let me think—yes, one of them is defined as ""Wash Bay."" So maybe that's what I need to use.

So, the first step is to match ""wash"" and ""bay"" against the keywords. The waypoint ""Wash Bay"" probably includes ""wash"" and ""bay"" in its description. Then, I need to look up its location. From the user prompt, it seems that the location would be where Wash Bay entrance is, maybe around (50, 75) on the coordinate system.

Putting this together, the steps are:

1. Ignore any extra tokens at the beginning. The query starts with ""Go to,"" so I ignore the leading words.
2. Match keywords: Looking for ""wash"" and ""bay."" Since ""Wash Bay"" is a waypoint, it should match.
3. Check if there's a waypoint that specifically matches this description. Yes, Wash Bay has the keywords we need.
4. Now, find its location in the coordinate system. The user prompt shows that Wash Bay entrance is at (50, 75).
5. Since this waypoint exists and satisfies both keyword matching and being clearly defined, I don't have any issues with invalid commands or ambiguity.

So, the response should guide the system to navigate to Wash Bay's entrance. That means using the ""navigate"" action with the correct coordinates.

I think that's it. The user didn't specify anything else, so this seems straightforward.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's try to figure out how to handle this user prompt. So the query is ""Go to the open area and tell them to clean up."" Hmm, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe they want me to instruct someone else about cleaning up? Or perhaps it's a way to say ""clean the open area,"" but I think the first interpretation makes more sense.

Looking at the options, they have two actions: navigate and speak. Since the query is asking for an action to take on a specific location, it seems like ""navigate"" would be the right choice. But before jumping into that, let me make sure there's no confusion with other waypoints or possible errors.

I should also consider any available waypoints. From the information given, there are several waypoint names and locations, but I'm not seeing one that matches just ""open area."" The closest might be the C&D Coffee Area, which is at (100, 100). So maybe they want to go to that specific location.

Wait a second, does the query mention any other actions? It doesn't specify what needs to be done after going there. Maybe I should just go with ""navigate"" since it's the primary action here. Also, if it were an invalid waypoint or extra tokens, I'd have to handle that error response mentioned earlier.

Putting it all together, the response would involve navigating to the specified location in the open area and telling others to clean up. That makes sense because it directly addresses the user's request without any additional actions needed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to help the user with their query. Let's break down what they're asking for. The prompt says: ""Take me to the Formula Electric WARG design team."" Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense because a formula electric WARG is something related to electric cars or perhaps a specific product line. But in this context, it seems like they might be referring to a waypoint.

Looking at the available waypoints from the user's prompt, I see ""WARG"" comes up with keywords like ""WARG design team."" So that could be one of the waypoints. Let me check each available waypoint:

1. **E7 ideas clinic**: Keywords include ""ideas"", ""clinic"".
2. **E7 concepts building - office space**: Keywords are ""E7"", ""building"", ""office"".
3. **RoboHub entrance**: Keywords like ""RoboHub"", ""entrance"".
4. **C and D areas**: Probably specific locations.
5. **Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic**: Keyword is ""ideas clinic"".

Wait, the user's query mentions ""Formula Electric WARG design team."" That doesn't align with any of the waypoints provided. The closest is ""WARG design team,"" which is part of a waypoint. Let me see if there's a waypoint named ""WARG"" or related.

Looking again, I don't find a waypoint that includes ""WARG"" as part of its name. The only related keyword is from ""E7"", but the query mentions ""Formula Electric WARG."" That seems incorrect because none of the waypoints have this keyword.

So, considering the rules, if after ignoring extra tokens there's nothing matching any waypoint's keywords or words in the name, the response should mention that it doesn't exist. In this case, since ""WARG"" isn't part of any available waypoint, I need to inform the user.

I think the best action is for the system to speak and state that this waypoint does not exist because none of the provided keywords or words in the name match any valid waypoint.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's request. The user wrote, ""Go to the paint room and tell them to clean up."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what they're asking for. They want me to instruct someone (probably me) to go to a specific location—paint room—and have them take action to clean up. But wait, the instruction isn't clear on who is cleaning up. Maybe it's an oversight or not entirely explicit in my message.

I should consider each part of their request separately. They mentioned two main things: going to the paint room and telling someone to clean up. The first part is straightforward—locate the paint room and navigate there. But the second part, where they tell someone to clean up, is a bit vague. Is it ""someone"" or ""they""? It's ambiguous. That could lead to misunderstandings.

Looking back at the available waypoints, none of them seem related to cleaning up. The closest might be "" ideas clinic,"" but that's about meeting people and giving gifts. There are no waypoints specifically for telling others to clean up. So if I follow through with my initial response on navigating to the paint room, the user might not complete their request as intended.

I also need to consider whether the query is part of a larger plan or just standalone. If it's part of another task, maybe they expected further actions after navigating to the paint room, but since the instruction isn't clear, I have to default to just doing what was given.

So, in my response, I should acknowledge their request and then provide the necessary instructions on how to go to the paint room. I'll mention that I can help navigate there and perhaps suggest providing materials or tools needed for cleaning if they're a team. But since it's vague about who is responsible for cleaning up, I'll stick to just guiding them through the process without making assumptions.

I should also check for any missing waypoints or actions mentioned in my response. Since the paint room isn't part of the available waypoints, I can explain that the user hasn't provided a relevant action yet and only needs help navigating there next time. This way, it avoids any confusion about what's expected.

Overall, I think my main goal is to provide clear instructions on where to go and perhaps offer some support beyond just navigating. That should cover the request as best as possible with the information given.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's query. Let me break it down step by step.

The user's prompt is ""Go to the Concrete canoe team."" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because there's no such place in the provided waypoints. The waypoints are about locations like C&D - Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance, etc., and they have specific names or descriptions.

First, I'll ignore any extra tokens at the beginning of the query. That part is just ""Go to the Concrete canoe team,"" which doesn't seem relevant here.

Next, according to the rules, each waypoint has keywords that the input must contain. For example, if a waypoint is named ""C&D Coffee Area"" and its keywords include ""coffee,"" then any input like ""coffee"" should match it. But in this case, there's no such thing as ""Concrete canoe team.""

I'll check all available waypoints to see if they mention anything related to the Concrete canoe team. Looking through the list, I don't see a waypoint that includes ""Concrete canoe."" The closest might be RoboHub Entrance or another location, but none seem directly related.

Since there are no keywords in any of the provided waypoints that match ""Concrete canoe team,"" this makes me think that such a request doesn't correspond to any valid waypoint. So, I need to output an error response indicating that the requested waypoint doesn't exist.

I should also consider if there's any ambiguity or multiple possible interpretations, but since none of the keywords are present in the waypoints, it seems clear that it's invalid.

So, my final response will be a ""speak"" action inputting the message about the request not existing. I need to make sure this is clear and follows the user's guidelines strictly.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

# Examples
Example Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?
Example Answer:
{
    ""actions"": [
        {
            ""action"": ""navigate"",

                ""y"": 50
            }
        }
    ]
}

Example Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.
Example Answer:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""RoboHub"",
        ""x"": 100,
        ""y"": 100
      }
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?""
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""wait"",
      ""input"": 10
    },
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic"",
        ""x"": 25,
        ""y"": 75
      }
    }
  ]
}

Example Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.
Example Answer:

Okay, let's try to figure out how to help this user. They've given me a list of waypoints and some rules to follow when responding to their queries. The user mentioned a specific prompt: ""Go to the concrete tobbagan team."" 

First, I need to understand what each waypoint is about. Looking through the available waypoints, I see that one is named ""Concrete tobbagan team"" with keywords like ""concrete"", ""tobbagan"", and ""team"". So this seems to be a relevant waypoint.

The user's instruction is to go to this specific team. Now, thinking about how to navigate the robot, if there's a waypoint for that location, it should allow the robot to move there. I don't see any extra tokens to ignore, so I just need to check if the input matches ""Concrete tobbagan team"".

Since it does match, the action is to navigate to this specific location within the ""concrete"" area. The coordinates are given as 100 x and 50 y. So the user will be sent there with that input.

If I were the system, I'd respond by speaking and sending the exact coordinates so the robot knows where to go. I should make sure to follow all the rules strictly, like ignoring any extra tokens and using only keywords from the waypoint name or description.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

# Examples
Example Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?

Alright, I need to figure out how to respond when someone asks to go to UWAFT's office. Let me start by recalling the rules and information given.

First, each waypoint has a set of keywords that can be used for matching. UWAFT is one of these waypoints. From the available keywords, ""UWAFT"" would match if it includes ""UWAFT"". Looking at the list, yes, UWAFT is directly listed.

Next, I need to ignore any extra tokens. The user's input here is ""Go to UWAFT's office"", which doesn't have any additional prefixes or codes, so that part stays as is.

Now, I'll check if ""UWAFT"" matches the keywords associated with it. Yes, ""UWAFT"" is one of the waypoints, and its keywords would include that name. So, it should be a valid reference.

Since this meets all the criteria—cleaned input has at least one keyword for UWAFT—and there's no ambiguity or multiple possible interpretations—the response should be to navigate to UWAFT's office.

Putting it together, the action is ""navigate"" with the required input.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to go to UWAFT's workbay. First, I need to look at the available waypoints to see if any match ""UWAFT"". 

Looking through the waypoint definitions, I don't see a waypoint named exactly like ""UWAFT"" or with keywords that match it. Some of them might be related but not exactly UWAFT. For example, ""Van"" is a keyword in one of them, but ""UWAFT"" isn't there.

So, since none of the waypoints directly mention ""UWAFT"", I think the correct response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. That means I should output an action where the system asks the user if they recognize UWAFT or provide additional details. 

I need to make sure the message is clear and direct, so it's helpful for the user without giving away any information about the waypoint. The error response will only occur when the input doesn't match any available waypoints.
