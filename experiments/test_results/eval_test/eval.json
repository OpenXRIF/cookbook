    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The prompt says: \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what's being asked here. There are two main actions: moving to a specific location called RoboHub and then proceeding to another place named Silent Study.\n\nI know that the supported functions include navigate, speak, and wait. So moving is handled by the navigate function, which requires specifying where to go. Proceeding might also involve navigating again or maybe some other action like waiting if there's a delay between moving to RoboHub and going to Silent Study.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, when multiple steps are involved, the actions are output in order. For instance, in one example, they used two navigate actions followed by a wait and then another navigate. So it seems like each movement or action is an individual step unless explicitly combined otherwise.\n\nI also need to check if both RoboHub and Silent Study are valid waypoints based on the list provided. From the waypoint definitions given earlier, I don't see entries for RoboHub or Silent Study. The known waypoints include places like Ideas Clinic, Coffee Area, etc., but not these two. So it's likely that neither is a recognized waypoint.\n\nIf both are unknown, then according to the handling complex commands section, if no known waypoint meets the threshold (which is 80% similarity by token), we output an action with \"action\": \"speak\" and explain that the waypoints don't exist.\n\nSo for each step:\n\n1. Navigating to RoboHub: Since it's unknown, this would result in a speak action stating that RoboHub doesn't exist.\n2. Proceeding to Silent Study: Similarly, since it's unknown, this would also trigger a speak action about Silent Study not existing.\n\nBut wait, the prompt says \"proceed to the Silent Study\" after moving to RoboHub. If both are unknown, we can't navigate anywhere. So perhaps each action is considered separately.\n\nTherefore, the first step would be to attempt to navigate to RoboHub. Since it's unknown, an error message is returned. Then, for proceeding to Silent Study, another error message is generated.\n\nSo the actions array should contain two speak actions with their respective errors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: RoboHub\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist: Silent Study\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
