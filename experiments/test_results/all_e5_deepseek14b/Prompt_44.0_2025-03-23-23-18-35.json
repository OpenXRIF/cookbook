Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 44.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: \"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the command. The starting point is (0,0). The first destination is \"Formula Electric Mech Bay.\" Looking at the waypoints, there's one named \"Formula Electric Mech Bay\" with keywords like \"formula,\" \"electric,\" \"mech,\" and \"bay.\" So that should match.\n\nNext, after Formula Electric Mech Bay, the user says \"then the Baja.\" I'll check for a waypoint named \"Baja.\" There is one listed with keywords including \"baja.\" So that's clear.\n\nThen the command has \"the to Rocketry.\" The word \"Rocketry\" isn't in any of the waypoints. Checking all the waypoints, none have \"rocketry\" as part of their name or keywords. So this part doesn't match any existing waypoint.\n\nNext is \"Midnight Sun,\" but again, looking through the list, there's no waypoint with that name or related keywords. \n\nSince Rocketry and Midnight Sun aren't valid waypoints, I can't process those parts. The user also mentioned waiting 5 minutes after Midnight Sun, but since that location isn't valid, the wait action can't be executed.\n\nSo, my response should navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay and then Baja, as they are valid. For Rocketry and Midnight Sun, since they don't exist, I need to inform the user about the invalid waypoints. However, according to the rules, if any part of the command is invalid after a valid action, the entire command might be considered invalid. But in this case, I can still process the first two valid steps and then inform them about the others.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the instructions: when processing multiple steps, each must be valid. Since Rocketry and Midnight Sun are invalid, I should output an error for those but also note that part of the command is valid. But according to the rules, if any waypoint doesn't match, the response should indicate that it doesn't exist. So perhaps after navigating to Baja, I need to inform them about the next waypoints not existing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe process as much as possible and then report the error for the invalid parts. Or perhaps since the entire command includes multiple steps with some invalid, the whole thing is invalid beyond the first two steps.\n\nBut in the examples provided, when part of a command is invalid, the response points out that it doesn't exist. So I think it's better to process the valid parts and then inform them about the invalid ones.\n\nWait, but according to the rules: if the input after cleaning doesn't match any waypoint keywords or names for any waypoint, output an error. But here, each step is a separate waypoint reference. So \"Formula Electric Mech Bay\" is valid, then \"Baja\" is valid, then \"Rocketry\" and \"Midnight Sun\" are invalid.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to process the first two steps (navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay, then Baja), and for the remaining steps, output an error since those waypoints don't exist. But in terms of actions, perhaps the robot should only perform up to the valid points before stopping.\n\nWait, but the user wants a single response. So if the command includes multiple steps with some invalid, do I handle each step individually? Or is it that the entire command must be valid?\n\nLooking back at the rules: For multi-step commands, list actions in order. If any waypoint doesn't match, output an error for that part. But since the user's request has four waypoints, two of which are invalid, maybe after processing the first two, I should return an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire command is considered invalid because it includes non-existent waypoints beyond the first two. However, in the examples given, if a single step is invalid, the response is an error. So maybe each step needs to be valid on its own.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is: \"Go to A, then B, then C.\" If A and B are valid, but C isn't, do I process A and B, or just return an error because C doesn't exist?\n\nI think according to the rules, each step must be a valid waypoint. So if any part of the command is invalid, the entire instruction might be considered invalid. However, in this case, since two steps are valid, but the next ones aren't, perhaps I should process up to the last valid step and then inform them about the invalid parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the robot stops at the first invalid waypoint and outputs an error message. For example:\n\n1. Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay.\n2. Then navigate to Baja.\n3. Attempting to go to Rocketry (invalid), so output error.\n\nBut in terms of a single response, perhaps I should list all actions and note where it fails. But the rules say that if any waypoint doesn't match, output an error for that part. So perhaps after navigating to Baja, I inform them about Rocketry not existing.\n\nWait, but looking back at the user's instruction: \"Go to A, then B, then C, then D.\" Each is a separate step. So the robot should process each in order, and if any step fails, it stops and reports the error for that specific step.\n\nSo first, navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay (valid). Then from there, navigate to Baja (valid). Next, attempt to go to Rocketry (invalid), so output an error about Rocketry not existing. Since the wait is after Midnight Sun, which is also invalid, perhaps the error message should include all invalid steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the robot processes each step sequentially and reports errors as they come.\n\nIn this case, I think it's best to process the valid steps first and then inform the user about the invalid ones. So:\n\n- Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay.\n- Then navigate to Baja.\n- Attempting Rocketry: invalid, so output error.\n- The wait is after Midnight Sun, which is also invalid.\n\nSo in the response, I should include the two valid navigations and then an error message about the remaining steps not existing. However, since the user's instruction is a single command with multiple steps, perhaps the correct approach is to process each step individually and report any errors as they occur.\n\nWait, but in the given example by the user, the response was only for the first valid step and then an error. So maybe after processing Formula Electric Mech Bay and Baja, I output that Rocketry and Midnight Sun don't exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since Rocketry and Midnight Sun are invalid, the entire command beyond the first two steps is invalid, so I process up to the last valid step (Baja) and then inform them about the other parts being invalid.\n\nI think in this case, the best approach is to navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay and Baja as they are valid, and then output an error message indicating that Rocketry and Midnight Sun don't exist. So I'll include both valid actions first and then the error.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Parse the Command:** The user instructs to navigate through four waypoints in sequence.\n2. **First Waypoint - Formula Electric Mech Bay:** Valid, as it matches an existing waypoint.\n3. **Second Waypoint - Baja:** Also valid, another existing waypoint.\n4. **Third Waypoint - Rocketry:** Invalid, no matching waypoint exists.\n5. **Fourth Waypoint - Midnight Sun:** Invalid, no matching waypoint exists.\n6. **Wait Command:** Cannot be executed as the preceding waypoints are invalid.\n\n**Response:**\n- Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay (valid).\n- Then navigate to Baja (valid).\n- Inform the user that Rocketry and Midnight Sun do not exist.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe robot will first navigate from the starting point (0,0) to the \"Formula Electric Mech Bay.\" Upon arrival, it will then proceed to the next destination, which is the \"Baja\" waypoint. However, when attempting to move to \"Rocketry,\" the robot recognizes that this waypoint does not exist in the provided list. Similarly, \"Midnight Sun\" is also an invalid waypoint.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe robot successfully navigates to the Formula Electric Mech Bay and then to Baja. The subsequent waypoints Rocketry and Midnight Sun do not exist. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigate\",\n      \"from\": [0, 0],\n      \"to\": [\"formula electric mech bay\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigate\",\n      \"from\": [\"baja\"],\n      \"to\": [\"baja\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"error\": \"The waypoints 'Rocketry' and 'Midnight Sun' do not exist.\"\n}\n```",
