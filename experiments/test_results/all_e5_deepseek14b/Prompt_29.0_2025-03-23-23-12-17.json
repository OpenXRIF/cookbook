Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n*Below is the users query to respond to*\n\"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\"",

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command. The user said, \"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the waypoint**: The user mentioned \"Assembly Room.\" I need to check if this is one of the predefined waypoints. Looking at the list provided, I don't see an \"Assembly Room\" listed. There's a lot of other rooms like Ideas Exchange, C&D - Coffee Area, E7-2150, etc., but no Assembly Room.\n\n2. **Check keywords**: Each waypoint has specific keywords associated with it. Since \"Assembly Room\" isn't in the list, none of the waypoints' keywords or names match this term. Even if I consider possible misspellings or alternative names, there's nothing that fits.\n\n3. **Handle invalid waypoint**: According to the rules, if the cleaned input doesn't include any of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, I should output an error message saying the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\n4. **Construct the response**: The response needs to be a JSON object with an \"speak\" action indicating the error. There's no need to navigate or wait since the command is invalid.\n\nI considered if there might be another name for Assembly Room that I'm missing, but based on the provided data, it doesn't exist. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
