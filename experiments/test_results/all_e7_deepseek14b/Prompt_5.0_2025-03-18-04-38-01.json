    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check if \"RoboHub\" is a valid waypoint. Looking back at the provided waypoints, I don't see \"RoboHub\" listed. There's a \"South Entrance,\" \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" etc., but nothing about RoboHub or Silent Study. \n\nNext, I need to handle this according to the rules. Since RoboHub isn't a known waypoint, I should return an error message using the speak action. The example given for an unknown waypoint shows that it returns a speak action saying the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also notice that the user's prompt has two parts: moving to RoboHub and then to Silent Study. But since both are unknown, I only need to address the first part in my response as per the example, which handles the first invalid waypoint mentioned.\n\nSo, my response should be a speak action informing the user that \"RoboHub\" doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
