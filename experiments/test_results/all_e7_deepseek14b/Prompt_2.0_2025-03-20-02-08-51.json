For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wants me to navigate to the Ideas Clinic first and then go to the Assembly Room.\n\nFirst, I'll start by checking if both waypoints exist in the list provided. Let me look through the waypoints:\n\n- \"Ideas Clinic\" is listed as \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\". So that's valid.\n- Next, \"Assembly Room\" isn't directly listed. Wait, looking again, there's an \"E5 Entrance\" but no Assembly Room. However, I see there's a waypoint called \"E5 Entrance\", which might be close to the assembly area. Alternatively, perhaps \"Assembly Room\" refers to another location not explicitly named. But since it's not in the list, maybe the user meant something else.\n\nWait, looking back, there is an \"Ideas Clinic\" as part of Room 1427, so that's clear. For the second part, \"Assembly Room\" isn't listed, but perhaps they meant \"E5 Entrance\" since it's under E5. Or maybe I should check if \"Assembly\" appears in any other waypoint names.\n\nLooking through the list again: There's an \"E5 Entrance\", which is in the South Side with coordinates (1535, 1535). No direct mention of Assembly Room. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or it's a different name. Since it's not present, I should respond that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The waypoints include \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\", and others like \"E5 Entrance\" but no Assembly Room. So, when the user says \"go to the Assembly Room,\" since it's not in the list, I should trigger an error message.\n\nTherefore, my response should first navigate to the Ideas Clinic, then attempt to go to the Assembly Room, which doesn't exist. But according to the instructions, if any part of the command is invalid or unknown, we return a speak action with the error message for that waypoint.\n\nSo, I need to process each step:\n\n1. Navigate to Ideas Clinic: valid.\n2. Then navigate to Assembly Room: invalid.\n\nSince the second step is invalid, the entire command becomes invalid. So, I should output an error message about \"Assembly Room\" not existing, rather than processing the first part and then failing.\n\nWait, but according to the example given in the prompt, if there's an unknown waypoint, it returns a speak action with that specific error. However, since this is part of a multi-step command, I need to determine whether to process the first valid step or return an error for the invalid second step.\n\nThe user instruction says: \"if any function beyond 'navigate', 'speak', or 'wait' is requested, return...\" but here it's navigate. The problem is that the second waypoint is unknown.\n\nIn the example where a user asked to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was an error message about the unknown zone. So in this case, since the second part is invalid, I should probably issue an error after processing as much as possible, but perhaps it's better to check each step.\n\nAlternatively, if the first part is valid and the second isn't, maybe only process the first part and then return an error for the second? Or just treat the whole command as invalid because one of the steps is invalid.\n\nLooking at the examples, in the first example, the user asked for two waypoints (C&D areas and RoboHub), and the response included both navigations. So it processed each step.\n\nIn another example, when the user tried to go to an unknown zone, the system returned an error immediately.\n\nSo perhaps I should process as much of the command as possible until hitting an invalid part.\n\nBut in this case, the first step is valid (Ideas Clinic), so I would navigate there and then attempt the second step. If the second is invalid, then return an error after processing the first action? Or just return the error.\n\nWait, according to the instructions: \"Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\" So process each part in order. So if the first part is valid, I should navigate there, then attempt the next step. If that fails, output an error for the second part.\n\nBut the way the response is structured, if any part of the command leads to an unknown waypoint or invalid action, it returns a speak action with the appropriate message. So perhaps in this case, since both steps are navigations and only the second is invalid, I should process the first step (navigate to Ideas Clinic) and then return an error for the second step.\n\nBut looking at the examples again, when the user tried to go to unknown zone and RoboHub, the system returned a speak action about the unknown zone without processing the RoboHub. So perhaps if any part is invalid, we don't process it and return the error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should process each step individually. Let me think: in the user's command, \"navigate to A then navigate to B,\" if A exists but B doesn't, do I:\n\n1. Navigate to A, then attempt to navigate to B, which fails, so output an error after processing A.\n\nBut in the system's examples, when a single step is invalid (like the unknown zone), it returns an error without processing further steps. So perhaps for a multi-step command, if any part is invalid, we return an error message about that specific invalid part.\n\nWait, but the example given was: user asked to go to unknown zone and then RoboHub, system returned error about unknown zone. So in this case, since \"go to Assembly Room\" is invalid after navigating to Ideas Clinic, perhaps I should process the first step (navigate) and then return an error for the second.\n\nBut according to the instructions, each action is processed in sequence. So if the first is valid, I do it; then the second is checked. If the second is invalid, I need to return an error message about that specific part.\n\nSo perhaps the response would include navigating to Ideas Clinic and then returning an error about Assembly Room not existing.\n\nBut looking at the user's example response:\n\n\"Here\u2019s how I would respond:\"\n\nThey processed both steps because they were valid. So in this case, since one step is invalid, I should process as much as possible (navigate to Ideas Clinic) and then return an error for the second part.\n\nWait, but according to the initial system message's example, when a user tried to go to unknown zone and RoboHub, the system only returned the error about the unknown zone. So perhaps if any step is invalid, we don't process further steps and just return the first encountered error.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since the second part is invalid, but the first is valid, I should process the first step (navigate to Ideas Clinic) and then return an error for the second step.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, when a user tried to go to unknown zone and RoboHub, the system returned an error about the unknown zone without processing the RoboHub. So perhaps in multi-step commands, only one error is given, and it's the first encountered invalid part.\n\nWait, no: that example was \"go to unknown zone then RoboHub\". Since the first step is invalid, the system returns the error about the unknown zone, ignoring the second valid step.\n\nSo applying that logic here, if any part of the command is invalid, we return an error message for the first encountered invalid part. But in this case, the first part (Ideas Clinic) is valid, so perhaps process it and then handle the second part as a separate error.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to assume that if any step is invalid, the entire command fails, but if steps are independent, each is processed until an invalid one is found.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a two-step command, both navigations, and only the second is invalid, perhaps process the first and then return an error for the second. But I'm not certain about that.\n\nGiven the examples provided in the system message, when the user tried to go to an unknown zone followed by RoboHub, the response was an error about the unknown zone without attempting the second step. So maybe if any part is invalid, we don't process further steps and return the first encountered error.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since \"Assembly Room\" isn't listed, it's treated as an invalid step, so I should return an error message about that, not processing the first valid step.\n\nBut wait, in the example where both steps are part of a single command, perhaps all parts must be valid to process any of them. Or is each action processed independently?\n\nI think according to the instructions, each action is processed as a separate command within the same overall command. So if you have \"A and then B\", it's two actions. If A is valid, do it; then check B.\n\nSo in this case:\n\n1. Process first: navigate to Ideas Clinic (valid).\n2. Then process second: navigate to Assembly Room (invalid).\n\nSince the second step is invalid, I should output an error message about \"Assembly Room\" not existing after processing the first step.\n\nBut how does that translate into a response? The user's example in the prompt showed each step being processed when both were valid. If one is invalid, perhaps it's better to process as much as possible and then inform the user of the failure at the second step.\n\nSo my response would be:\n\n- First, navigate to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic.\n- Then, attempt to navigate to Assembly Room, which doesn't exist, so return an error message about that.\n\nBut according to the system's instruction, if any part of the command is invalid, we should return a single error message. So perhaps in this case, since \"Assembly Room\" isn't found, I don't process the first step and just inform the user.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example with unknown zone and RoboHub, it returned an error about the unknown zone without processing RoboHub, even though that was a valid step. So perhaps if any part of the command is invalid, we return the error immediately without proceeding further.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since \"Assembly Room\" isn't found, I should return an error message before processing the first step.\n\nBut then again, it's possible that each action in the sequence is checked for validity before execution. So perhaps I need to check each part of the command:\n\n- The user's command is: navigate to A; then navigate to B.\n- First, check if A exists. If yes, proceed and do it.\n- Then, check if B exists. If yes, proceed and do it.\n\nIn this case, since both are checked before execution, I can process each as long as they exist. So:\n\n- Check \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" \u2013 exists, so navigate there.\n- Check \"Assembly Room\" \u2013 doesn't exist, so return an error message about that after the first step.\n\nTherefore, my response would include navigating to the first location and then informing the user about the second part's invalidity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in such a system, all parts of the command must be valid before any action is taken. So if one part is invalid, no actions are taken.\n\nBut I'm not certain. To avoid confusion, I'll proceed by assuming that each step is processed individually and return an error for any invalid steps encountered after processing valid ones.\n\nSo in this case:\n\n1. Navigate to Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic (valid).\n2. Attempt to navigate to Assembly Room (invalid), so inform the user about it.\n\nTherefore, my response would be: \"I'm sorry, but I can't find the location 'Assembly Room'.\"\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't find the location 'Assembly Room'.",
