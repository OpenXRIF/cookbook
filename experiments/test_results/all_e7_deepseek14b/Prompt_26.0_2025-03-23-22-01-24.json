For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Enterance?\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Enterance?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user says, \"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Enterance?\" \n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the user is starting and where they want to go. The starting point is clearly stated as \"Microwaves.\" Looking through the waypoints provided, I see that there's a waypoint named \"Microwaves\" with coordinates X: [value], Y: [value]. So, that's my starting location.\n\nNext, the destination mentioned is \"E5 Enterance.\" Wait, in the list of waypoints, I don't see an exact match for \"E5 Enterance.\" There is, however, a waypoint named \"E5 Entrance\" which might be the intended target. It's possible that the user made a typo and meant to type \"Entrance\" instead of \"Enterance.\"\n\nUsing the fuzzy matching steps provided, I'll normalize both the input and the waypoint names to lowercase. The user's input becomes \"e5 enterance,\" and the waypoint is \"e5 entrance.\" Removing any extraneous tokens, which in this case might be just checking for building codes or non-essential identifiers at the beginning.\n\nTokenizing both, the user's input has [\"e5\", \"enterance\"], while the waypoint has [\"e5\", \"entrance\"]. Comparing these, I notice that \"enterance\" vs. \"entrance\" is a slight misspelling but likely intentional since the user might have mistyped it. \n\nCalculating similarity, all tokens from the waypoint are present in the input except for the last token being slightly off. However, considering the high percentage match (both have two tokens with one differing by just one letter), I can infer that the user intended to refer to \"E5 Entrance.\"\n\nTherefore, the navigation should be from Microwaves to E5 Entrance. \n\nI need to structure the response with actions. Since the user is starting at Microwaves and wants to go back to E5 Entrance, the system should navigate first from the starting location (Microwaves) to the destination (E5 Entrance). \n\nWait, but according to the example answer provided in the prompt, when navigating between waypoints, the system should use the \"navigate\" action with the appropriate waypoint name. So in this case, the actions array should have one \"navigate\" action pointing to E5 Entrance.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm using the correct waypoint name as per the data given. Looking back, the waypoint is named \"E5 Entrance,\" so that's what I'll use in the response.\n\nFinally, since both waypoints are valid and there's a clear path based on the fuzzy match, the actions will be straightforward: navigate from Microwaves to E5 Entrance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 1834,\n                \"y\": [coordinate not provided]\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I realize that the exact coordinates for \"E5 Entrance\" aren't provided in the initial data. So, perhaps it's better to indicate the waypoint name without specific coordinates since they weren't given.\n\nRevised response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nBut according to the system, when navigating between waypoints, it's better to include both starting and ending points. However, since the user started at Microwaves, maybe I should indicate that.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the action should be a single navigate command from the current position (Microwaves) to E5 Entrance.\n\nBut in the system's examples, they often include the name of the waypoint without coordinates if they aren't specified. So perhaps it's acceptable as above.\n\nFinal response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
