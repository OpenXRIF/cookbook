    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"I could really go for a shower.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the user is asking for. They mentioned wanting a shower, which likely means they want to navigate to a location where showers are available. Looking at the provided waypoints, I see options like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"RoboHub Entrance,\" and others, but none explicitly mention a shower or bathroom.\n\nWait, maybe there's an implicit waypoint related to showers that isn't listed here? But in the given data, all waypoints are either areas like C&D, RoboHub, or specific functions like Coffee Area, etc. There's no \"shower\" or \"bathroom\" mentioned as a waypoint.\n\nSo, if I try to match the user's request with the available waypoints, there isn't an exact match. The system uses fuzzy matching, but in this case, \"shower\" doesn't correspond to any known waypoint tokens after normalization and tokenization.\n\nAccording to the instructions, if no known waypoint meets the similarity threshold, I should output a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. So, I can't navigate anywhere because there's no matching shower location.\n\nI don't have enough information to proceed beyond informing the user that their requested waypoint isn't recognized. There are no other functions or steps needed here since the command is singular and doesn't involve multiple actions or waiting.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint they're asking for doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **User Request Analysis:** The user wants to go for a shower, implying navigation to a shower location.\n2. **Waypoint Matching:** No waypoints correspond to showers or bathrooms based on the provided data.\n3. **Action Selection:** Since no matching waypoint exists, trigger a speak action with an error message.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
