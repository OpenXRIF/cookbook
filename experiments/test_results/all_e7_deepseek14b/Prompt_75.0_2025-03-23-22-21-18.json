For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to respond to this prompt. The user is giving a detailed command to a robot, instructing it to make several deliveries in different areas of a building.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the command step by step. The robot starts at C&D - Hot Food Area, then moves to RoboHub, Ideas Clinic, Assembly Room, and finally back to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nI'll check each waypoint mentioned against the list provided. C&D - Hot Food Area isn't listed, so that might be a problem. Wait, but looking through the waypoints, I see \"C&D - Coffee Area\" exists, but not Hot Food. Maybe it's an error or perhaps the user meant Coffee Area.\n\nNext, RoboHub is a known waypoint. So the robot should navigate there after starting from C&D - Coffee Area. Then Ideas Clinic and Assembly Room are both listed as waypoints, so those are valid.\n\nWait, in the prompt, the first step is to start at C&D - Hot Food Area. Since that's not a valid waypoint, the response should include an error message about the unknown location. But according to the instructions, if any part of the command is invalid, we return an error for the specific unknown zone.\n\nSo the initial navigation to C&D - Hot Food Area isn't valid, so the robot can't proceed further. It needs to inform the user that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
