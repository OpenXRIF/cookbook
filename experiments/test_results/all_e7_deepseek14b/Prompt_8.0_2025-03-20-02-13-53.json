For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt where they mention wanting to visit two specific waypoints in a building. The user says, \"I'm feeling peckish. Can we swing by the C&D - Snack Area and then grab a drink at the C&D - Cold Drink Area?\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the user is asking for. They want to go to two places: first, the snack area in C&D, and then the cold drink area also in C&D. So, I need to identify these two waypoints from the list provided.\n\nLooking at the waypoint data, I see several entries under C&D, including Snack Area, Cold Drink Area, etc. The names of these waypoints are listed as \"C&D - Snack Area\" and \"C&D - Cold Drink Area.\" These seem to match exactly what the user is asking for.\n\nNext, I need to determine the order of actions. The user mentioned visiting the snack area first and then the cold drink area, so the sequence should be navigating to each in that specific order.\n\nI'll structure the response as a series of navigate actions. Each action will specify the name of the waypoint along with their respective x and y coordinates. Since these are the starting points from (0,0), I can assume the initial position is there, but for the output, I just need to include each navigate step.\n\nI should also make sure that each waypoint's name is correctly referenced as per the data provided. So \"C&D - Snack Area\" and \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\" are the exact names to use in the actions.\n\nI don't see any other functions like speak or wait needed here since the user only asked for navigation between two points. There's no interaction required beyond moving from one place to another, so I can omit those actions.\n\nFinally, I'll format the response as a JSON array with each navigate action, ensuring that each has the correct name and coordinates. Since the starting point is (0,0), but the destinations have their own coordinates, I'll include them as specified in the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Snack Area\",\n        \"x\": 2005,\n        \"y\": 1277\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Cold Drink Area\",\n        \"x\": 2005,\n        \"y\": 1277\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
