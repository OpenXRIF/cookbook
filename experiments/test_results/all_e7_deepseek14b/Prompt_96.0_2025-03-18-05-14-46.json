    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Robot, go to [[Silent Study]], say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice, and wait for 15 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the command. The robot is being told to navigate to a location called \"Silent Study,\" then speak a specific message in a calm tone, and finally wait for 15 minutes.\n\nI should check if \"Silent Study\" is an existing waypoint from the provided list. Looking through the waypoints, I see names like Shower A, various C&D areas, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but there's no mention of \"Silent Study.\" \n\nSince it doesn't exist, according to the guidelines, I need to return a speak action indicating that the waypoint is unknown. The other parts of the command can't be processed because without the valid location, navigating and waiting aren't possible.\n\nI should structure the response as an array with one action: speaking the error message. No other actions are needed since there's no valid waypoint to proceed further.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
