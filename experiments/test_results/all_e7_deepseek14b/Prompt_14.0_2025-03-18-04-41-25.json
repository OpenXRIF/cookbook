    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Go from nroth enterance to the Hub\". First, I notice that the user might have made a typo with \"nroth\" instead of \"north\". But looking at the available waypoints, there's no \"North Entrance\". Wait, actually, checking the list provided earlier, there is a \"South Entrance\" but not a \"North Entrance\". So maybe the user meant \"south entrance\", but they wrote it as \"nroth enterance\". \n\nLet me look back at the normalization step. The user input is converted to lowercase, so \"nroth enterance\" becomes \"nroth enterance\". Now, I need to compare this against the waypoint names after normalizing them. The South Entrance's normalized name would be \"south entrance\". Comparing these, they don't match because of the typo in \"nroth\".\n\nNext, considering tokenization. The user's input is split into [\"nroth\", \"enterance\"], while the closest waypoint, South Entrance, is [\"south\", \"entrance\"]. There's no overlap here, so similarity score would be zero. Therefore, it doesn't meet the threshold.\n\nSince there are no matching waypoints, I should respond by speaking that this waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, perhaps the user meant another entrance? Looking at the list again, there's a South Entrance and an East Side with Shower B. Maybe they confused \"south\" with \"north\"? Since the system can't assume that, it's safer to treat it as an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo, the response should be to speak that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
