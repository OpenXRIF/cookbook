For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Go from nroth enterance to the Hub\"\n",

    "num_waypoints_injected": 20,
    "Data Set": "E7-1",
    "Experiment ID": 2.0,
    "Prompt ID": 14.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go from nroth enterance to the Hub\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Go from nroth enterance to the Hub.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the user might have misspelled \"north\" as \"nroth.\" So, the starting point is \"nroth enterance.\" Looking at the list of waypoints provided, there's a \"RoboHub Entrance,\" which seems like a possible match. But wait, the user wrote \"enterance,\" which could be \"entrance.\" However, in our waypoint list, the exact name is \"RoboHub Entrance\" or perhaps just \"RoboHub\" as a main entrance.\n\nNext, I have to apply the advanced fuzzy matching steps. Let's normalize both inputs by converting them to lowercase: user input becomes \"nroth enterance,\" and each waypoint name, like \"robohub entrance,\" would also be lowercase.\n\nNow, for extraneous token removal. The user input doesn't seem to have any building codes or extra identifiers beyond the words. So, I can proceed without removing anything here.\n\nTokenization: Splitting both inputs into tokens. User's input has [\"nroth\", \"enterance\"], and each waypoint name would be split into their respective parts.\n\nLooking at similarity calculation. For a match to occur, every token from the waypoint should be present in the user's input or about 80% of the tokens should be there. So, checking \"robohub entrance,\" does it have tokens that are in the user's input? The user has \"nroth\" which might not directly match \"robohub.\" But considering possible misspellings or misinterpretations, \"nroth\" could refer to \"north,\" and if there's a waypoint named \"North Entrance,\" but looking at our list, I don't see that. Instead, the closest is \"RoboHub Entrance.\"\n\nWait, in the given waypoints, the main entrance for RoboHub might just be referred to as \"RoboHub\" or maybe it's listed under a different name like \"Entrance.\" Looking back at the data provided, I don't see an explicit \"North Entrance,\" so perhaps \"nroth enterance\" is intended to refer to RoboHub.\n\nAlternatively, if there's no exact match, I need to check if any tokens are present. The user's input has two tokens: \"nroth\" and \"enterance.\" Comparing with each waypoint name:\n\n- For \"RoboHub Entrance\": tokens are [\"robohub\", \"entrance\"]. The user's input has none of these tokens exactly, but perhaps \"enterance\" is a misspelling of \"entrance.\" If we consider that, maybe it matches.\n\nHowever, the similarity threshold requires either all tokens from the waypoint to be in the user's input or 80% coverage. Since \"robohub\" isn't in the user's input, unless there's some other way to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also check if any waypoints start with codes that can be stripped, like \"nroth\" could be a code. But according to the normalization and token removal steps, I don't see any initial tokens with letters and digits in the user's input, so maybe not applicable here.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the user meant \"north entrance,\" but there isn't such a waypoint listed. So perhaps they're referring to RoboHub as the destination after starting from north entrance, which might be near or connected to it.\n\nBut looking at our waypoints, RoboHub is located at specific coordinates (from earlier data). The only other entrance I see is \"Starting Locations\" but that's at 0,0. Hmm, perhaps the user meant to go from a northern area to the Hub, but without exact waypoint names matching, it's tricky.\n\nWait, in the user's prompt, they wrote \"nroth enterance,\" which might be an attempt to say \"north entrance,\" and then \"the Hub\" which likely refers to RoboHub. So, perhaps the starting point is north entrance (even though not explicitly named) and destination is RoboHub.\n\nBut according to our data, there's no waypoint called \"North Entrance.\" So maybe the user made a mistake in spelling or naming.\n\nIn this case, I have to rely on the available waypoints. The closest match for the starting location might be \"RoboHub Entrance,\" but since that's the destination, perhaps the user intended to start from somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, if there's no exact match, the system should respond with a speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait, looking at the initial data provided, I see waypoints like \"Shower A\" and others in the East area. There is a \"Starting Locations\" at (0,0), but that might not be relevant here.\n\nIn the given data, the only entrances mentioned are for RoboHub as part of its name. So, perhaps the user's starting point isn't recognized because it's misspelled or doesn't exist in the list.\n\nTherefore, when processing \"nroth enterance,\" after normalization and tokenization, none of the tokens match any waypoint names, so no similarity is found.\n\nFor the destination, \"the Hub\" likely refers to RoboHub. So, checking if there's a waypoint named \"RoboHub.\" Yes, in the data provided earlier, there's a RoboHub with specific coordinates (but not listed here). Assuming that it exists as a waypoint named \"robohub.\"\n\nSo, perhaps despite the starting point being unclear due to misspelling, the destination is clear. But according to the fuzzy matching rules, if neither the start nor end points match any existing waypoints, the system can't process the request.\n\nTherefore, the response should inform the user that either the starting or ending waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user's prompt is \"Go from nroth enterance to the Hub.\" After analyzing the input and applying fuzzy matching steps, it appears there is no recognized starting point named \"nroth enterance\" in the available waypoints. The destination, \"the Hub,\" likely refers to RoboHub, which does exist. However, since the starting point isn't recognized, the system cannot process the request.\n\n**Response:**\nI'm sorry, but I couldn't find a waypoint matching \"nroth enterance.\" Could you please check the name and try again?",
