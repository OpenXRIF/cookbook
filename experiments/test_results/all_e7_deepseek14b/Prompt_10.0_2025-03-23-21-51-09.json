For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Starting at the Microwaves, can you guide me back to the E5 Entrance?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this prompt. The user is asking for guidance from the Microwaves back to the E5 Entrance. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where each waypoint is located based on their coordinates. The Microwaves are at a certain x and y coordinate, and the E5 Entrance is another point. Since the starting location is (0,0), which isn't mentioned in any of the waypoints except as a reference for the Starting Locations, I have to see how to get from Microwaves back to E5.\n\nWait, looking at the data provided, Microwaves are listed under C&D areas? Or no, wait, checking the list again, I don't see an entry specifically for Microwaves. Let me look through the waypoints:\n\n- The list includes:\n  - Role\n  - Waypoints with names and coordinates: Ideas Clinic, RoboHub, E5 Entrance, etc.\n  - Then under \"Starting Locations\": (0,0)\n  - Available functions are navigate, speak, wait.\n\nWait a minute, I don't see Microwaves listed in the waypoints. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each waypoint:\n\n- Starting at the top: Ideas Clinic is a role, not a coordinate.\n- Then under Advanced Fuzzy Matching for Waypoints, there's a list of waypoints with their names and coordinates, but I don't see Microwaves or E5 Entrance in that list. Wait, no: looking again, I think I missed it.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"Microwaves\" as a starting point. Let me check if that's present:\n\nLooking through each waypoint, I don't see an entry for \"Microwaves.\" The closest is under the section labeled with \"-\" and then some waypoint names, but perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, no, maybe I need to parse the initial data correctly. Let me look carefully: after the role description, there's a list of waypoints starting from \"Understanding User Prompts\" onwards, each listed with their coordinates.\n\nWait, no, actually, the initial data seems to be structured as follows:\n\n- Role\n- Then various sections like Advanced Fuzzy Matching for Waypoints, Handling Complex Commands, etc., but under those, I see specific waypoint entries. Let me check that again.\n\nLooking through the JSON structure provided by the user in their message, it's actually a mix of instructions and waypoints.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. The user included:\n\nWaypoints listed with names like \"Ideas Clinic\" and coordinates, but no Microwaves or E5 Entrance. Wait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for \"Microwaves\":\n\nAh, in the section under # Handling Complex Commands, there's a waypoint named \"E5 Entrance\" with x=1834, y=1834? Or wait, perhaps that's a different location.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list all the waypoints as per the data:\n\nFrom the user's message, after the initial Role description, under the section labeled \"Waypoints\" (though not explicitly named), there are entries like:\n\n- Ideas Clinic\n- RoboHub\n- E5 Entrance\n\nWait, no: looking again, perhaps each waypoint is listed with their coordinates as part of the JSON structure. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for any mention of \"Microwaves.\" Looking through the user's message, under the waypoints section, I see:\n\nLooking at each item:\n\n- E5 Entrance: yes, it's in the list, with x and y coordinates as 1834. But wait, no, looking back, perhaps that's a different part.\n\nWait, actually, the data provided by the user includes a list of waypoints under various sections, but I'm not seeing \"Microwaves\" explicitly listed. Therefore, when the user starts at the Microwaves and wants to go back to E5 Entrance, since Microwaves isn't a known waypoint, it's an invalid request.\n\nSo the system should respond by speaking that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user requested navigation from \"Microwaves\" to \"E5 Entrance.\" Since \"Microwaves\" is not listed as a valid waypoint in the provided data, the system recognizes this as an unknown location. Therefore, it responds with an error message indicating that \"Microwaves\" does not exist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
