    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this prompt where the user says, \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assemble Room.\" Hmm, let me figure out how to handle this. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the command. It's a two-step navigation: first to the Ideas Clinic, then to the Assemble Room. I should check if both waypoints exist in the provided list.\n\nLooking at the waypoints listed earlier, I see \"Ideas Clinic\" isn't there. Wait, actually, in the initial waypoint data, there's no mention of \"Ideas Clinic\" or \"Assemble Room.\" So that means both are unknown. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me go through each waypoint name to see if any match these names. Scanning through: C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Ideas Clinic? No, the waypoints provided don't include either of those. The closest is \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and \"C&D - Donuts.\" So neither \"Ideas Clinic\" nor \"Assemble Room\" are present.\n\nSo since both waypoints are unknown, I need to respond accordingly. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an action with \"speak\" and the message that the waypoint doesn't exist. But in this case, there are two unknown waypoints. \n\nWait, but the prompt is a sequence: first navigate to Ideas Clinic, then Assemble Room. Since both don't exist, it's an invalid command. So the appropriate response would be to output one speak action indicating that the request is invalid because those waypoints aren't found.\n\nI should structure the JSON response with an \"actions\" array containing a single speak action. The input string will inform the user that the requested waypoints don't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Ideas Clinic' and 'Assemble Room' are not valid waypoints\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
