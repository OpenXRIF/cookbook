    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe user provided a detailed setup with predefined waypoints, functions, and examples. The task is to generate an action based on a given prompt using these rules.\n\nThe specific prompt here is: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse this command. The main instruction is to navigate to a waypoint called \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nLooking at the available waypoints listed, I don't see any named \"E7 silent study.\" The closest ones are like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and others, but none match \"E7 silent study.\"\n\nI need to apply the advanced fuzzy matching steps. Let me go through them:\n\n1. **Normalization**: Convert both user input and waypoint names to lowercase. So, \"e7 silent study\" vs. all lowercase waypoint names.\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal**: Remove any tokens that look like building codes or non-essential identifiers. In the prompt, \"E7\" could be a code, so I might remove it. The remaining part is \"silent study.\"\n\n3. **Tokenization**: Split into words. \"e7 silent study\" becomes [\"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\"]. After removing \"e7,\" we have [\"silent\", \"study\"].\n\nNow, compare with each waypoint name's tokens after normalization and tokenization.\n\nLooking at the waypoints:\n- \"Starting Locations\": Not relevant here.\n- \"Available Functions\": Also not relevant for navigation.\n- Waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" are tokenized as [\"c\", \"&\", \"d\", \"-\", \"coffee\", \"area\"], which doesn't match.\n\nNone of the waypoints have tokens matching \"silent study.\" Even if I consider similar terms, there's no waypoint related to a silent study area.\n\nSo, since no known waypoint matches, according to the rules, I should return an action that speaks and says the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI don't need to navigate anywhere else because the command is only about moving to this non-existent location. Therefore, the response should be a speak action with the appropriate message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
