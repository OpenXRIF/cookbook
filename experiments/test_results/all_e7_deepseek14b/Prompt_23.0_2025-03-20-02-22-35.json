For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 23.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assemble Room.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's query. The prompt says, \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assemble Room.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify each waypoint mentioned in the command. The user mentioned two places: \"Ideas Clinic\" and \"Assemble Room.\"\n\nI'll start by looking up \"Ideas Clinic\" in the list of waypoints provided. From what's listed, there's an \"Ideas Clinic\" located at coordinates (0, 0). Wait, no\u2014looking back, actually, I think the Ideas Clinic is at specific coordinates but maybe not (0,0). Let me check.\n\nWait, the starting location is given as (0,0), so perhaps the Ideas Clinic isn't there. Let me look again: the list includes \"Ideas Clinic\" with X and Y coordinates specified in JSON earlier, but I might have to refer back to the data.\n\nHmm, in the initial waypoint list provided by the user, the Ideas Clinic is listed as a waypoint, right? So according to that, it's one of the waypoints. Similarly, \"Assemble Room\"\u2014I think that's another name for the \"Assemble Room,\" but looking at the waypoints, there's an \"Assemble Room\" or maybe \"Assemble\" isn't explicitly mentioned.\n\nWait, in the list provided earlier, I don't see an \"Assemble Room.\" Let me check again. The user listed several waypoints like E5 Entrance, Ideas Clinic, RoboHub, etc., but not an \"Assemble Room.\"\n\nSo if the user is asking to go to the Assemble Room and that waypoint isn't in the list, then it's considered unknown or invalid.\n\nTherefore, when processing this command:\n\n1. The first part is to navigate to the Ideas Clinic. That should be straightforward since it's a known waypoint.\n2. Then, from there, navigate to the Assemble Room. But since Assemble Room isn't listed, that becomes an issue.\n\nI need to apply the advanced fuzzy matching as per the instructions.\n\nFor \"Ideas Clinic,\" I can match that exactly because it's one of the waypoints. So the first action is to navigate there.\n\nNext, the user says \"then go to the Assemble Room.\" Since Assemble Room isn't in the list, this part will fail.\n\nAccording to the handling of unknown waypoints, I should return an action where the AI speaks that the waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, the command has two parts: first navigate to Ideas Clinic and then to Assemble Room. If the second part is invalid, how do I handle it?\n\nI think the processing should be in sequence. So the AI will try to process each step one by one. Since the first step (Ideas Clinic) is valid, it can perform that action. Then, when it tries the second step (Assemble Room), which is invalid, it should output an error message.\n\nBut looking at the example provided where the user asked about \"unknown zone,\" the response was a speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist. So in this case, since Assemble Room isn't found, I should respond accordingly after attempting the first step.\n\nWait, but if the AI successfully navigates to Ideas Clinic but then fails on the next command, how is that handled? Do I include both actions or just stop at the first error?\n\nI think according to the instructions, if any part of the command is invalid, it should return an error. But in this case, since the first part is valid and the second isn't, perhaps the AI can perform the first action but then inform about the second.\n\nHowever, looking at the examples given, when a waypoint is unknown, the response is to speak that it doesn't exist. So if the user's command includes multiple steps and one of them is invalid, the AI should process as much as possible and then handle the error for the invalid part.\n\nBut in this specific case, since \"Assemble Room\" isn't found, the second navigate action would be invalid. Therefore, the response should only include up to the first valid action and then an error message, or perhaps just the error if it's the second step.\n\nWait, no, the command is a single request with two steps: first go to Ideas Clinic, then Assemble Room. If the entire command isn't possible because part of it is invalid, I think the AI should handle the first valid action and then return an error for the unknown waypoint.\n\nBut looking at the instructions under \"Handling Complex Commands,\" it says to process commands left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So in this case, the AI would attempt to navigate to Ideas Clinic, which is fine, and then upon trying to go to Assemble Room, realize it's invalid and return an error message.\n\nHowever, since the prompt requires me to output actions, I think the correct response is to first navigate to Ideas Clinic and then, when attempting the next step, inform that Assemble Room isn't found. But in this case, perhaps the user only wants one response, so maybe the AI should handle both steps if possible.\n\nWait, no\u2014since the second step fails, the overall command can't be completed as intended. Therefore, the AI would process the first part successfully and then return an error message for the second part.\n\nBut in terms of output, I think the example where a single unknown waypoint is given results in just the speak action. So perhaps in this case, since both steps are required but one is invalid, the response should be to navigate to Ideas Clinic as much as possible and then inform about Assemble Room being invalid.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the instructions: if any part of the command is invalid, it's handled by returning an error. But in this case, since the first step is valid and the second isn't, perhaps the AI can proceed with the first action but return an error for the second.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to process as much as possible and then inform about the remaining part being invalid.\n\nBut given the example where a single unknown waypoint was used, I think in this case, the response should be that Assemble Room isn't found, which is the main issue here. The first part (Ideas Clinic) is valid but perhaps not needed if the second part fails.\n\nWait, no\u2014the command has two parts. So the AI would attempt to process each step. Since the first step is valid, it would do so and then proceed to the next. Upon finding that Assemble Room isn't a valid waypoint, it should return an error message for that specific part.\n\nTherefore, the response should include navigating to Ideas Clinic as the first action but then inform the user about Assemble Room not being found in the second step. However, in terms of output format, since each command is processed sequentially, and if any part fails, the AI would need to return an error message after processing the valid steps.\n\nBut in the given example where a single unknown waypoint was used, the response was just a speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist. So perhaps in this case, even though there are two steps, the focus is on the invalid step, so the response should be that Assemble Room isn't found.\n\nAlternatively, since the first part is valid and the second isn't, maybe the AI can still proceed with the first action and then inform about the second. But I'm not sure how to structure that in the output format.\n\nLooking at the initial example given:\n\nWhen the user asked about \"unknown zone,\" the response was a speak action indicating it doesn't exist. So perhaps in this case, since the command has two parts and one is invalid, the AI should process as much as possible but then inform about the invalid part.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the entire command is considered invalid because the second step isn't possible. Therefore, the AI would return an error for the whole command, not just part of it.\n\nWait, no\u2014the instructions say to handle each action in sequence. So first, navigate to Ideas Clinic (valid), then attempt to go to Assemble Room (invalid). Since the second step is invalid, perhaps the overall command fails, and the AI should return an error after attempting the first part.\n\nBut I think according to the problem statement, if any step is invalid, it's handled by returning an error for that specific part. So in this case, since Assemble Room isn't found, the response would be just a speak action indicating that.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the AI should process the first part (navigate to Ideas Clinic) as valid and then handle the second part (Assemble Room is unknown), but since the user's output example only shows the error message, perhaps the focus is on the invalid step.\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial command was \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assemble Room.\" Since both are required, and the second isn't valid, the entire command can't be fully executed. So the response should be that the second part is invalid.\n\nBut in terms of the output format, it's just a speak action indicating that Assemble Room doesn't exist. Therefore, the thought process leads me to conclude that since \"Assemble Room\" isn't a valid waypoint, the AI responds with an error message.\n</think>\n\nThe user's command includes navigating to two locations: the Ideas Clinic and then the Assemble Room. The Ideas Clinic is a valid waypoint, but the Assemble Room is not listed among the known waypoints. Therefore, the response should indicate that the second part of the command is invalid.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Validity of Each Waypoint:**\n   - \"Ideas Clinic\" is a valid waypoint.\n   - \"Assemble Room\" is not found in the list of waypoints.\n\n2. **Process Commands Sequentially:**\n   - The first command to navigate to Ideas Clinic is valid and can be executed.\n   - Upon attempting the second command, it's discovered that Assemble Room isn't a valid waypoint.\n\n3. **Handle Invalid Command:**\n   - Since the second part of the command is invalid, an error message is generated to inform the user.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe AI successfully navigates to the Ideas Clinic but encounters an issue with the second step. It informs the user that \"Assemble Room\" isn't a valid location.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{I'm sorry, but \"Assemble Room\" isn't a valid location.}}",
