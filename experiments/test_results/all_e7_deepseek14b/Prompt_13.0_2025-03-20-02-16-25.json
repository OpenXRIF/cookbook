For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Take my to the HubRobo\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt where they say, \"Take my to the HubRobo.\" First, I notice that there might be a typo in \"my\" instead of \"me.\" That could just be a mistake, and I should interpret it as them wanting to go somewhere.\n\nThe main part here is \"HubRobo.\" I remember from the waypoint list provided earlier that there's a \"RoboHub.\" The user probably meant that. So my first step is to check if \"HubRobo\" matches any of the existing waypoints when processed through the fuzzy matching steps.\n\nLet me go through each of the advanced fuzzy matching steps as outlined:\n\n1. **Normalization:** Convert both inputs to lowercase. The user's input becomes \"take me to the hubrobo,\" and the waypoint name is \"RoboHub.\" Lowercasing gives us \"hubrobo\" and \"rob_hub.\"\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:** For \"hubrobo,\" there are no non-essential tokens, but for \"rob_hub,\" I should check if any part looks like a building code or unnecessary. \"RoboHub\" doesn't have such parts, so it stays.\n\n3. **Tokenization:** Split both into words. The user's input is [\"take\", \"me\", \"to\", \"the\", \"hubrobo\"], and the waypoint is [\"rob\", \"hub\"].\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:** Now I need to see if every token from the waypoint appears in the user's input or if a high percentage of them do. The waypoint tokens are \"rob\" and \"hub.\" Looking at the user's input, \"hubrobo\" contains \"hub,\" but not \"rob\" as a separate word. Alternatively, maybe \"hubrobo\" is a single token that includes both \"rob\" and \"hub\" in some way.\n\nHmm, this is tricky because \"HubRobo\" might be an alternate spelling or a misspelling of \"RoboHub.\" Since the user's input has \"HubRobo,\" I should consider if it matches any known waypoints when processed. The known waypoint is \"RoboHub,\" which when lowercased and tokenized becomes [\"rob\", \"hub\"]. The user's input after processing is [\"hubrobo\"], so maybe there's a match here because both contain the root words \"hub\" and \"rob.\"\n\nI think the similarity is high enough because the core terms are present. Even though the tokens don't exactly match, the user intended to refer to RoboHub.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:** Since only RoboHub matches (as HubRobo likely refers to it), I can proceed with navigating there.\n\nSo, considering all this, the appropriate action is to navigate to RoboHub. The starting location is (0,0), but I don't have specific coordinates for RoboHub in the data provided, but that's okay because the function just needs to know the name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
