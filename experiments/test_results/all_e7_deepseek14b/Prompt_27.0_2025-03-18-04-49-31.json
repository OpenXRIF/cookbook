    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by breaking down the command into parts. The user is asking to navigate to the Elevators, wait for 15 seconds, and then go to the East Entrance.\n\nI remember that in the waypoint list provided, there isn't an entry named \"Elevators\" or \"East Enterance.\" Wait, I see \"Shower A\" on the East Side, but not an elevator. Hmm, maybe the user meant a different location. Alternatively, perhaps they made a typo. The closest match might be \"East Entrance,\" but that's not in the list either.\n\nLooking back at the waypoints, there are several exits and entrances listed, like Shower A on the East Side and others, but no specific elevator or east entrance. So when the user refers to the Elevators, I can't find a matching waypoint.\n\nSince the first part of the command is invalid because \"Elevators\" isn't a known waypoint, I should return an error message right away. The system requires each step to be valid, and if any action is invalid, it can't proceed further.\n\nTherefore, my response should inform the user that their request includes an invalid waypoint, specifically pointing out \"Elevators.\" I'll use the speak action to convey this error.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Elevators' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
