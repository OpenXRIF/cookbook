For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into parts. The first action is to navigate to the Elevators. Then, wait for 15 seconds at that location. After waiting, the next step is to find the East Entrance.\n\nI should check if \"Elevators\" is a valid waypoint from the list provided. Looking through the waypoints, I see \"Elevator\" isn't listed directly, but there's an \"E5 Entrance\". Wait, maybe \"Elevators\" refers to E5? Or perhaps it's another entrance. Alternatively, maybe \"Elevator\" is part of another name like \"E5 Elevator\".\n\nBut looking at the list, I don't see a waypoint named \"Elevators\". The closest is \"E5 Entrance\", which is located at coordinates (1535, 1535). However, the user mentioned \"Elevators\", so perhaps that's not matching exactly.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let me check all waypoints again:\n\n- E5 Entrance: yes, at (1535,1535)\n- Elevators: no direct match\n\nHmm, maybe the user meant E5 Entrance as the elevators. Or perhaps they're referring to a different entrance that isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe \"Elevators\" is part of another name, but none of the waypoints seem to include it.\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"E5 Entrance\" which might be where the elevators are located. So perhaps the user is referring to E5 as the elevator location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a waypoint that includes both \"Elevator\" and another identifier. But from the given list, it doesn't seem so. The only entrance near E5 is E5 itself.\n\nSo, for the first part of the command, navigating to Elevators might not be possible because it's not a valid waypoint. Therefore, I should return an error message indicating that \"Elevators\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user made a typo or is referring to \"E5 Entrance\". Since E5 is close to elevators, perhaps they meant that. But according to the instructions, I need to match exactly using fuzzy logic as per the guidelines.\n\nFollowing the normalization and tokenization steps: the user input \"Elevators\" would be converted to lowercase, and tokens would be [\"elevators\"]. Then, comparing against each waypoint name:\n\n- For example, \"E5 Entrance\" becomes [\"e5\", \"entrance\"], which doesn't include \"elevators\". \n\nTherefore, no matching waypoints. So the first action is invalid.\n\nSince the first part of the command is invalid, I should return an error message for that part and not proceed further.\n\nSo the response would be a speak action indicating that \"Elevators\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
