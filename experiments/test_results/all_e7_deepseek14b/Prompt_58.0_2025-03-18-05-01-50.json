    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt using the given waypoints and following all the rules provided. The prompt is \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the user's command to identify the action and any associated waypoint names. Here, the action is clearly \"navigate\" since they're asking to be taken somewhere. The target is \"E7 silent study,\" which seems like a specific location.\n\nNext, I need to check if \"E7 silent study\" matches any of the existing waypoints provided. Looking through the list, I see waypoints like E Rolezone, E7, and others, but nothing explicitly named \"E7 silent study.\" \n\nFollowing the advanced fuzzy matching steps: \n1. Normalize both the input and waypoint names to lowercase.\n2. Remove extraneous tokens. The user's input has \"e7\" which might be a building code or identifier. I should remove it as per the instructions since it's at the beginning and contains letters and digits.\n3. Tokenize the cleaned input, which would be \"silent study.\"\n4. Compare with each waypoint name token by token. The closest match seems to be \"E7\" but without more tokens matching, it doesn't reach the similarity threshold of 80% or more.\n\nSince there's no exact match and none meet the required token presence, I conclude that \"E7 silent study\" isn't a valid waypoint. Therefore, I should output an action where the agent speaks to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm only using the supported functions: navigate, speak, wait. In this case, since it's an invalid command, speaking is the appropriate response.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the actions array will contain a single speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
