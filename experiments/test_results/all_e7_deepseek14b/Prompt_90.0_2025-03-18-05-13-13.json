    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this prompt where the user is asking the robot to navigate to \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" and then announce that location. Let me break down how I'd approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" exists as a waypoint. Looking at the provided data, there are several C&D areas like Coffee, Tea, etc., but not Hot Food. So, it's likely an unknown waypoint.\n\nSince the robot doesn't recognize it, according to the guidelines, I should return a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. There's no need to proceed with navigation if the destination isn't valid.\n\nI should also make sure I'm using the correct JSON structure for the response, including the \"speak\" action with the appropriate message.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
