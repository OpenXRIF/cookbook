    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this user prompt that says, \"Let's chek out the Novelties store, and then head out the South Entrence.\" Hmm, first off, I notice a typo in \"chek\" which should probably be \"check,\" but maybe it's just a mistake. The main points here are checking out the Novelties store and heading out the South Entrence.\n\nI need to figure out if these locations exist based on the waypoints provided. Looking at the available waypoints, I see there's a \"South Entrance\" listed. But wait, the user wrote \"South Entrence.\" That's close enough with just one letter off. So that should match after normalization and tokenization.\n\nAs for the \"Novelties store,\" I don't recall any waypoint named exactly like that in the list provided. The available waypoints are all related to C&D areas and specific entrances, so it doesn't seem like there's a Novelties store listed. Maybe the user meant another location or perhaps it was a typo.\n\nSo, breaking down the commands: first, check out the Novelties store, then head out the South Entrance. Since I can't find the Novelties store, I'll need to inform the user about that and proceed with the part I can handle, which is navigating to the South Entrance if possible.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the waypoints, there's no Novelties store either. So, both parts might not be valid. Alternatively, maybe the user meant a different place but used the wrong name. However, without any similar names in the waypoints, I have to assume it doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the actions should first attempt to navigate to the South Entrance since that exists (after correcting \"Entrence\" to \"Entrance\"), but inform the user about the Novelties store not existing. Alternatively, if both are invalid, just speak about both.\n\nWait, no\u2014since in the user's prompt, they have two separate actions: first check out Novelties, then head out South Entrance. If one is invalid and the other is valid, I should process what I can. But according to the instructions, if any part is invalid, return an error for that waypoint.\n\nSo, in this case, since both waypoints might not exist or only one exists, I need to check each. Novelties store isn't there, South Entrance is. So perhaps the first action would be to speak about the invalid Novelties, then proceed with navigating to South Entrance.\n\nBut wait, according to the rules, if a waypoint doesn't exist, return a speak action saying so and don't process further. But in this case, the user has two separate commands: check out and head out. So perhaps each is a separate command.\n\nWait no, it's one sentence with two parts connected by \"and.\" So according to the processing instructions, process left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So first navigate to Novelties store, then South Entrance.\n\nBut since Novelties isn't valid, I should return an error for that and not proceed further. Or maybe, if multiple steps are involved and one fails, handle each step accordingly? But in the example given, when a waypoint is unknown, it just returns the speak action without processing the rest.\n\nSo perhaps, first try to navigate to Novelties store, realize it's invalid, then inform the user, and not proceed with the second part. Alternatively, if both are processed as separate commands, but the user's prompt combines them into one command string, I might need to handle each in sequence.\n\nBut according to the rules, process commands left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So first, attempt to navigate to Novelties store, which doesn't exist, so return an error message about that waypoint not existing. Then, maybe the second part is ignored or processed separately? Hmm, but in the example where the user had two parts and one was invalid, it returned a single speak action.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, when the user asked to go to \"unknown zone\" and then RoboHub, the response was a single speak action indicating the unknown zone is invalid. So maybe if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire action is aborted with that error message, without processing further.\n\nIn this case, since the first part is invalid (Novelties store), I should return that it doesn't exist and not proceed to the second part.\n\nBut wait, in the user's prompt, they wrote \"South Entrence\" which might be a typo for \"South Entrance.\" So perhaps after correcting that, South Entrance exists. But since the first part is invalid, maybe only the first action is considered, but according to the rules, if any waypoint doesn't exist, return an error.\n\nAlternatively, since both waypoints are separate actions in one command, I might need to handle them as such, but if either is invalid, process each step accordingly. But in this case, perhaps it's better to consider that the first part is invalid and return an error message about Novelties store, without proceeding further.\n\nWait, no\u2014because the user said \"Let's chek out...\" which might be a typo for \"check,\" but if they meant \"check out\" as in visit or explore, perhaps it's not necessarily a waypoint. But according to the system, I think waypoints are specific locations listed. So unless Novelties store is a waypoint, it's considered invalid.\n\nSo, to sum up: the user wants to first check out the Novelties store and then head out the South Entrence. Neither of these exists as valid waypoints (except maybe South Entrance if we correct the typo). Therefore, I need to inform the user that Novelties store doesn't exist. But since South Entrance does exist (after correcting), perhaps after informing about Novelties, proceed with navigating to South Entrance.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if any part of a command refers to an invalid waypoint, it should return an error and not process further actions in that command. So I think in this case, the response would be a speak action indicating that \"Novelties store\" doesn't exist, without processing the second part.\n\nWait, but maybe the system can handle each part separately if they're part of the same command. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me check the examples again.\n\nIn the example where the user said to go to unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was a single speak action about the unknown zone, so it seems that if any part is invalid, the entire command is aborted with an error message for the first invalid waypoint encountered.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since the first part (Novelties store) doesn't exist, I should return a speak action indicating that and not process the second part. But wait, no\u2014the user's command is to check out Novelties store AND head out South Entrence. So perhaps each is its own action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system processes each step in sequence. If the first step (checking out Novelties) fails, it should inform and not proceed with the second step.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact behavior here. To be safe, I think the best approach is to process each part as separate actions within the same command string. So first attempt to navigate to Novelties store, which doesn't exist\u2014so return an error message for that. Then, since it's a single command with two steps, perhaps only the first invalid step is handled and the rest are ignored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both parts need to be valid to proceed. But in this case, one is invalid, so the whole thing is aborted.\n\nWait, looking at the example again: when the user said \"go to unknown zone and then RoboHub,\" the system responded with a single speak action about unknown zone not existing. So perhaps, in such cases, any invalid waypoint within the command string causes the entire command to fail with an error message for that waypoint.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since Novelties store is invalid, the response would be a speak action indicating that it doesn't exist and not proceed further.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused. To make sure, perhaps I should just process each part and if any are invalid, return an error message for each invalid waypoint encountered. But in this case, only Novelties is invalid; South Entrance (if corrected) is valid. So maybe the response would be to inform about Novelties not existing, then proceed with navigating to South Entrance.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if any part of a command refers to an invalid waypoint, it should return an error and not process further actions in that command. Therefore, I think the appropriate response is to speak about Novelties store not existing.\n</think>\n\nThe user's request involves two parts: checking out the Novelties store and heading out the South Entrence. Upon reviewing the available waypoints, the Novelties store does not exist, while \"South Entrence\" appears to be a typo for \"South Entrance,\" which is listed as a valid waypoint.\n\nGiven the instructions, if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire action should be aborted with an error message. Therefore, the system will inform the user that the Novelties store does not exist and will not proceed further.\n\n**Response:**\n- Speak action indicating that \"Novelties store\" does not exist.",
