    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Robot, go to Silent Study and say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify the waypoints mentioned. The main waypoint here is \"Silent Study.\" Looking at the provided waypoints, I see that there's no exact match for \"Silent Study.\" There are options like \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\" or \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" but none specifically named \"Silent Study.\"\n\nNext, I'll apply the advanced fuzzy matching steps. Normalize both inputs to lowercase: \"silent study\" and compare against each waypoint name in lowercase. Then, remove any extraneous tokens that might be building codes or non-essential identifiers. After tokenization, check for similarity by seeing if all tokens from the waypoint are present in the user's input or if a high percentage match exists.\n\nSince none of the waypoints exactly match \"Silent Study,\" I'll have to determine if any partial matches exist. If no known waypoint meets the threshold, I should return an action where the robot speaks that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nAdditionally, the command includes two actions: navigating to \"Silent Study\" and speaking there in a calm voice. However, since the waypoint isn't recognized, the first action fails, which affects the entire sequence.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm only using supported functions: navigate, speak, wait. In this case, navigate is part of the command but without a valid waypoint, so it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response is for the robot to inform the user that \"Silent Study\" isn't a valid waypoint by speaking the error message.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
