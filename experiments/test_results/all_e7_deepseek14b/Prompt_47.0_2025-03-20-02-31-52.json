For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 47.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wants me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the microwaves. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if \"E5 Entrance\" is a valid waypoint. Looking at the list provided, there's an entry called \"E5 Entrance\" with coordinates (1535, 1535). So that part seems straightforward; I can navigate there without any issues.\n\nNext, after reaching E5 Entrance, the user wants me to find the microwaves. Now, looking through the list of waypoints provided earlier, I don't see a waypoint named \"Microwaves\" or anything similar. The available waypoints include various C&D areas with different functions like coffee, tea, etc., but nothing about microwaves.\n\nSince \"microwaves\" isn't listed as a valid waypoint, I need to handle this appropriately. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an action that speaks and states the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo the actions would be: first navigate to E5 Entrance, then attempt to find microwaves, which fails. But since the second part is invalid, I should only include the navigation to E5 and then inform the user about the non-existent microwave location.\n\nWait, but looking back at the examples, when an unknown waypoint is mentioned after a valid one, it's handled by returning an error message for the unknown part. So in this case, even though the first part (E5 Entrance) is valid, since the second part isn't, I should return a speak action indicating that \"microwaves\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe navigate to E5 and then inform about microwaves. But according to the guidelines, if any part of the command leads to an invalid or unknown waypoint, it's handled by returning the error message without executing subsequent actions.\n\nSo in this case, I should first check both waypoints. Since E5 is valid but microwaves are not, perhaps navigate to E5 and then speak about microwaves being invalid. But looking at the example where a command includes an unknown zone, it just returns the error message for that specific waypoint without executing any actions.\n\nWait, no\u2014the example given was \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\" The response was a single speak action stating 'invalid request' because of 'unknown zone.' So in this case, since E5 is valid but microwaves aren't, perhaps I should process up to the valid part and then handle the invalid one.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, for unknown waypoints, we return an action with \"speak\" indicating it doesn't exist. However, if a command includes multiple steps, we process them in sequence unless explicitly told otherwise. So perhaps the correct approach is to first navigate to E5 Entrance (since it's valid) and then attempt the next step, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say that for unknown waypoints, return an error message without executing any further actions. Or do they? Let me check the \"Supported Edge Cases\" section: if a waypoint is unknown, return an action with speak saying \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So perhaps in this case, since the second part of the command refers to an unknown waypoint (microwaves), I should output just that.\n\nWait, but E5 Entrance is valid. Do I need to navigate there first before realizing that microwaves are invalid? Or do I process each step and only execute up to the last valid one?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me look at the examples again. In the example where the user asks to go to an unknown zone, the response was just a speak action about it being invalid. So perhaps if any part of the command refers to an unknown waypoint, even in a sequence, I should output that error without processing further steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe process each step in order: navigate to E5 first, then attempt to find microwaves, which would then trigger an error message.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, when matching user input against waypoints, if no known waypoint meets the threshold, output a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So perhaps for the second part of the command, I should return that message.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, process the first step: navigate to E5 Entrance (valid). Then, attempt to find microwaves. Since that's invalid, respond accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the example where a user asked to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was only about the unknown zone. So perhaps any mention of an unknown waypoint in the command should be handled with an error message without executing any other steps.\n\nHmm. Maybe it's safer to process each step individually. If the first step is valid, proceed; if the second isn't, then return an error for that specific part. But since I'm supposed to handle commands as a sequence, perhaps execute all possible actions until an invalid one is encountered.\n\nIn this case, navigate to E5 Entrance (valid), and then attempt the next step: find microwaves, which is invalid. So after navigating, I should output the error message about microwaves not existing.\n\nBut looking at the guidelines again, it's stated that for each unknown waypoint, return an error message without executing further actions. Or does it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user's prompt is to go to E5 Entrance and then find microwaves. Since E5 is valid, but microwaves aren't, the correct response would be to first navigate to E5, then inform that microwaves are invalid.\n\nBut according to the guidelines in the problem statement, when an unknown waypoint is encountered, it should return a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So perhaps after navigating to E5, the second step fails, so I need to include both actions: navigate and then speak.\n\nWait, but maybe the user expects to execute all valid steps before informing about the invalid one. Alternatively, the system might stop at the first invalid part.\n\nI think according to the guidelines, if any part of the command leads to an unknown waypoint, it's handled by returning that error message without processing further actions. But I'm not entirely sure because in some cases, you might have multiple steps where only some are invalid.\n\nIn this case, since E5 is valid and microwaves aren't, perhaps process both: navigate to E5 and then inform about microwaves being invalid.\n\nBut let me check the example given in the problem statement. The user provided an example where they asked to go to the unknown zone, and the response was a speak action about that. So perhaps if any part of the command is invalid, it's handled by returning the error message for that specific waypoint without executing other steps.\n\nBut since E5 is valid, maybe I should proceed with navigating there and then handle the microwaves as invalid.\n\nI think the safest approach is to process each step in order. So first, navigate to E5 Entrance (valid), which would be done. Then, attempt to find microwaves, which isn't a valid waypoint, so return an error message for that.\n\nSo the response would involve both actions: navigating and then speaking about the invalid microwave location.\n</think>\n\nThe system processes each step in order. First, it navigates to E5 Entrance since it's a valid waypoint. Then, upon attempting to find microwaves, which isn't a valid waypoint, it returns an error message.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Parse the Command:** The user instructs to travel to E5 Entrance and then find the microwaves.\n2. **Validate Each Step:**\n   - \"E5 Entrance\" is a valid waypoint.\n   - \"Microwaves\" is not listed as a valid waypoint.\n3. **Execute Valid Actions First:** Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n4. **Handle Invalid Request:** After navigating, attempt to find microwaves and fail, resulting in an error message.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nFirst, I will navigate to the E5 Entrance as it's a valid waypoint. However, upon attempting to locate microwaves afterward, I realize that there isn't a valid waypoint for that location. Therefore, I'm unable to proceed further with finding the microwaves.\n\nThe system responds by navigating to E5 Entrance and then informing the user about the invalid microwave request:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": [\n    {\n      \"command\": \"navigate\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"location\": \"E5 Entrance\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"command\": \"speak\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"message\": \"The location 'microwaves' does not exist.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
