    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the user is asking for here. The prompt says, \"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\" Hmm, so I need to figure out how to respond.\n\nFirst, I should identify the waypoints mentioned: Assembly Room and Ideas Clinic. Wait, looking back at the provided waypoint data, there's no entry for Assembly Room or Ideas Clinic. The available waypoints are things like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and others related to C&D, RoboHub, etc. So, these specific locations aren't listed.\n\nI remember from the instructions that if a waypoint isn't recognized, I should return an action with a speak input indicating it doesn't exist. Also, for any invalid commands, just return a single speak action with an error message.\n\nSo, since both Assembly Room and Ideas Clinic are unknown, my response should be to inform the user that those waypoints don't exist. I'll structure this as an actions array with one speak action stating the issue.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
