    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if \"E7 silent study\" is a valid waypoint. Looking through the list of waypoints provided, I don't see any that match this description. The available waypoints include places like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Ideas Clinic,\" and others related to C&D areas but nothing about E7 or a silent study.\n\nNext, according to the instructions, if a waypoint isn't found, I should return an action with \"speak\" that informs the user the waypoint doesn't exist. So, in this case, since \"E7 silent study\" isn't listed, the appropriate response is to speak that message.\n\nI don't need to consider any other actions like navigating or waiting because there's no valid destination. The priority is to inform the user of the invalid command first.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
