    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the components of the command. The user is asking to be taken to a location called \"E7 silent study.\" My job is to determine if such a waypoint exists based on the provided data and then generate the appropriate response.\n\nLooking at the waypoints listed, I see names like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Silent Study,\" etc. There's no mention of an \"E7\" area or any silent study related to E7. The only silent study is under C&D.\n\nNow, considering the user's command, they might be referring to a specific area like E7, which isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. I should check if there are any waypoints that start with \"E\" but don't match exactly.\n\nSince none of the provided waypoints match \"E7 silent study,\" I'll need to respond that this waypoint doesn't exist. According to the guidelines, if the waypoint isn't found, I should output a speak action indicating it's invalid.\n\nI should structure my response as an array with one action: speaking the message about the waypoint not existing. No other actions are needed since navigation is impossible without a valid waypoint.\n\nSo, the final answer will be a JSON object containing a single speak action informing the user that \"E7 silent study\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
