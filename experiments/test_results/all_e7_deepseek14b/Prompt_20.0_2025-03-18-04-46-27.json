    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this user prompt step by step. The user wrote, \"I need freshen up. Take me Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we go can.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying the key components of the command. The user is requesting a series of actions: navigating to Shower A, then to Shower B, waiting for one minute at Shower B, and finally going somewhere referred to as \"we go can.\" \n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, I notice that there's an entry named \"Shower A\" with coordinates (0.0, 0.0). However, there's no mention of a \"Shower B\" in the list. This means that while the first part of the command is valid, the second navigation to Shower B isn't recognized.\n\nThe user then wants to wait for one minute at Shower B and proceed to \"we go can.\" Since \"we go can\" doesn't match any known waypoint and isn't a standard command, it's ambiguous. \n\nFollowing the guidelines provided, if there are multiple waypoints that meet the similarity threshold, I should select the one with the highest score. However, in this case, only Shower A is valid. The subsequent parts of the command involve invalid or unknown waypoints, which leads to ambiguity because the system can't interpret \"we go can.\"\n\nAs per the instructions, if any part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, the entire action should result in a speak response indicating an error. Therefore, instead of processing partial commands and risking incorrect actions, it's safer to return an error message.\n\nI'll structure the response to include a single speak action informing the user that their request contains invalid waypoints or ambiguous instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Shower B' and 'we go can' are not valid waypoints\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
