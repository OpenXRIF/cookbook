    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Navigate to Ideas Clinic and then go Assembly Room.\" First, let me break down what needs to be done.\n\nI remember from the guidelines that I have to process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless stated otherwise. So, the first step is to navigate to the Ideas Clinic. Then, after that, I need to go to the Assembly Room.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, I see that there's an entry for \"Ideas Clinic\" with coordinates (25, 75). But wait, in the initial data, it was listed as \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic.\" So I should make sure to match this correctly.\n\nNext, the user mentioned \"Assembly Room.\" Checking the list of waypoints, I don't see any entry named exactly \"Assembly Room.\" There's an \"Assembly\" waypoint at (50, 50), but it doesn't have a specific room number. However, maybe \"Assembly Room\" is referring to that. Alternatively, perhaps it's another name for one of the other rooms.\n\nSince I don't find an exact match for \"Assembly Room,\" I might consider if any existing waypoint could be similar or related. The closest is just \"Assembly\" at (50, 50). It's possible the user intended to refer to this point as the Assembly Room.\n\nIf there's no exact match, according to the guidelines, I should return a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. But since the first part of the command does have a valid waypoint, I might handle each part separately.\n\nSo, for the first part, navigating to Ideas Clinic is straightforward. For the second part, since Assembly Room isn't found, I need to inform the user about that.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"Assembly Room\" was meant to be another specific location not listed here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or miscommunication. However, based on the data provided, I can only match exact names.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Navigate to Ideas Clinic.\n2. Attempt to navigate to Assembly Room.\n3. Since Assembly Room isn't found, respond that it doesn't exist.\n\nBut according to the handling rules, if any part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, return a speak action with an error message for each invalid part. However, since this is a sequence, perhaps I should process the first valid action and then inform about the second.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat the entire command as ambiguous because one part is invalid, but that might not be necessary if only the second part fails.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, in the third example where \"unknown zone\" was mentioned, it returned a speak action for each invalid waypoint. However, in this case, the first part is valid, and the second isn't.\n\nI think I should process the first command successfully and then handle the second one's error separately. So, my actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to Ideas Clinic.\n2. Then attempt to navigate to Assembly Room, which doesn't exist, so speak that it doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, in the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown, return an action with \"speak\" and the input \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So for each invalid waypoint, I should issue such a message.\n\nHowever, since the user's prompt includes two waypoints, perhaps I need to process both. But I'm not sure if it's allowed to have multiple actions where only one is valid. Maybe I should return all possible actions, including the successful navigation and then the error for the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat the entire command as invalid because part of it is invalid, but that might not be correct since the first part is valid.\n\nWait, looking at the example where the user asked to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was a single speak action indicating the error. But in this case, the first part is valid, so perhaps I should proceed with the first action and then handle the second one's error.\n\nSo my plan is:\n\n- First, navigate to Ideas Clinic.\n- Then, attempt to go to Assembly Room. Since it doesn't exist, return a speak action for that.\n\nBut in JSON format, I need to include all actions, even if some are errors. So perhaps the response would be two actions: one navigate and then one speak.\n\nHowever, looking at the supported edge cases, if any waypoint is unknown, we output an action with \"speak\" and the message. But since the first part is valid, I think both actions should be included: the successful navigation and then the error for the second.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after navigating to Ideas Clinic, I should check the next command and find that Assembly Room isn't a waypoint, so return an error at that point.\n\nBut in terms of processing commands in sequence, maybe each part is handled individually. So first process \"Navigate to Ideas Clinic,\" which works, then process \"go to Assembly Room,\" which doesn't exist, leading to an error message.\n\nTherefore, my response should include both actions:\n\n1. Navigate to Ideas Clinic.\n2. Then, attempt to navigate to Assembly Room, but since it's unknown, speak the error message.\n\nSo in JSON, I would have two actions: one navigate and one speak. But looking back at the examples, when a waypoint is invalid, only the error is returned, not a combination of valid and invalid actions.\n\nWait, perhaps that's more accurate. Since the command includes multiple waypoints, if any part is invalid, maybe the entire command should result in an error message. However, I'm not sure because the first part is valid.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, each command is processed in sequence. So if the first part works and the second doesn't, both actions are included with the second resulting in an error.\n\nThus, my response would be:\n\n1. Navigate to Ideas Clinic (valid).\n2. Attempt to go to Assembly Room (invalid), so speak \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nSo the JSON would include two actions: a navigate action and then a speak action.\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"navigate\",\n    \"coordinates\": [25, 75]\n  },\n  {\n    \"action\": \"speak\",\n    \"message\": \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n  }\n]\n```",
