For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"There's no good coffee here.

    "Prompt ID": 31.0,
    "Prompt": "\"There's no good coffee here. Don't go to the C&D\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has given me a prompt: \"There's no good coffee here. Don't go to the C&D\". I need to determine how to respond appropriately based on the guidelines provided.\n\nFirst, I should parse the user's message. The main instruction seems to be about not going to the C&D area because there's no good coffee there. So, the user is advising against visiting a specific location, which in this case might relate to the C&D - Coffee Area waypoint since that's where coffee would be available.\n\nNext, I need to check if the mentioned \"C&D\" matches any known waypoints. Looking at the list provided, there is indeed a waypoint named \"C&D - Coffee Area\". So, the user is specifically warning against navigating to this location because of poor coffee quality.\n\nNow, considering the functions allowed: navigate, speak, and wait. The user isn't asking me to do anything like move or fetch something; instead, they're giving advice about where not to go. My role here is to process commands, but since this is more of a warning rather than an instruction, I need to see if it's a command that requires action.\n\nHowever, the prompt doesn't directly ask me to perform any function. It's more like a statement or a suggestion. Therefore, based on the supported actions, I don't have any navigate or speak commands to execute here. The only possible action would be to wait, but there's no indication of needing to wait in this scenario.\n\nSo, since the user hasn't given me a command that requires me to take an action, and they've merely provided information about avoiding a location, I should respond by acknowledging their statement or perhaps confirming that I understand not to go there. But according to the guidelines, if the command is a statement without any specific actions required, I might just need to output nothing or perhaps a speak action indicating my understanding.\n\nWait, but in this case, since it's an advisory and not a direct command, maybe the best response is to do nothing except perhaps wait if necessary. However, there's no indication that waiting is needed here. Alternatively, if the user wants me to avoid the location, I should ensure that in future actions I don't navigate there.\n\nBut since this is just a prompt without any specific commands following it, maybe the appropriate response is to recognize the instruction and adjust my behavior accordingly, but since the output needs to be an action based on the provided JSON structure, perhaps the best course is to not take any action unless instructed. Therefore, I should probably return nothing in terms of actions or just a speak action acknowledging receipt.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, when there's no valid command, sometimes a speak action is used to indicate errors, but in this case, it's more of a directive rather than an error. So perhaps I should output a speak action that acknowledges the user's advice.\n\nAlternatively, since the user hasn't provided any actionable commands beyond the advisory, maybe the system doesn't need to do anything except wait if instructed, which isn't the case here.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky because it's more of an advisory statement than a command. I think the safest approach is to treat it as a speak action where the AI acknowledges the user's advice, but since there's no specific instruction beyond that, perhaps no further actions are needed.\n\nWait, in the example prompt, when there was an unknown zone, the response was a speak action indicating the error. In this case, the user isn't giving me a command to navigate anywhere; they're just advising against it. So maybe I should output nothing because there's no function to perform beyond acknowledging, but since the functions only include navigate, speak, and wait, perhaps a speak action is appropriate.\n\nBut in the given prompt, the user is telling me not to go to C&D, so if I were to process this as a command, it would mean that any subsequent navigation commands should avoid C&D. But without further instructions, there's no need to take immediate action. Therefore, perhaps the correct response is to do nothing and wait for more instructions.\n\nWait, but in the guidelines, if the user provides an invalid or ambiguous command, we return a speak action with an error message. However, this isn't exactly an invalid command; it's more of a suggestion. So maybe I should treat it as a valid instruction that affects future actions but doesn't require an immediate response.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to output nothing because there's no function to perform here. But looking at the examples, when the user gives an advisory, like in the first example where they ask for something from C&D and drop it off elsewhere, the AI navigates accordingly.\n\nIn this case, since the user isn't asking me to do anything but is giving advice, I don't need to perform any actions. So perhaps the correct response is no action because there's nothing required beyond acknowledging the statement, which doesn't translate into a function call.\n\nWait, but in JSON terms, if I have to output an action, maybe it's better to include a speak action indicating that I've received the instruction not to go to C&D. For example: {\"action\": \"speak\", \"text\": \"I understand, I won't go to the C&D area.\"}\n\nAlternatively, since the user is just making a statement and not giving a command, perhaps no JSON output is needed because there's no action required.\n\nBut in the context of the system, if it receives such an advisory, it might adjust its behavior for future commands. However, without being told to remember or adjust, I can't take any specific action beyond what's immediately commanded.\n\nIn conclusion, since the user hasn't given me a command that requires navigation, speaking, or waiting, but has provided advice against visiting C&D, perhaps the appropriate response is to do nothing and wait for further instructions. Therefore, no JSON output is necessary unless I need to acknowledge receipt of the instruction, which might require a speak action.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if there's an advisory without a command, it's unclear whether to respond with anything. So maybe the safest approach is to output a speak action acknowledging the advice.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"speak\",\n  \"text\": \"I understand, I won't go to the C&D area.\"\n}\n```",
