    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user sent a prompt where they're telling me to navigate to North Entrance, speak the name of that waypoint, and then wait for 10 minutes. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the command. The main parts are: navigating to North Entrance, speaking \"North Entrance,\" and waiting for 10 minutes. Each part is a separate action, so they should be executed in sequence.\n\nI'll start with navigation. Looking at the available waypoints, North Entrance is listed with coordinates (951,616). So I can create a navigate action with those details.\n\nNext, after arriving, I need to speak \"North Entrance.\" That's straightforward\u2014just a speak action with the input string.\n\nThen comes waiting for 10 minutes. Wait actions usually take an integer value in seconds. Since the user said 10 minutes, I'll convert that to 600 seconds because 10 multiplied by 60 is 600. So, the wait action will have 600 as its input.\n\nI should check if all these functions are supported. The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait, which covers everything needed here. No need to worry about unsupported actions.\n\nAlso, I don't see any ambiguity in the commands. Each instruction is clear and follows a logical order\u2014go first, then speak, then wait. So I can process them one after another without issues.\n\nI should make sure each action is properly structured in JSON format as per the examples provided. No typos or syntax errors here.\n\nFinally, putting it all together, the actions array will have three entries: navigate to North Entrance, speak the name, and wait for 600 seconds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 951,\n                \"y\": 616\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"North Entrance\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 600\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
