    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking, \"Where can I find an ark reactor, can you go there?\" Hmm, let me break this down. First, they're looking for something called an \"ark reactor.\" I don't recall any waypoints named that from what's provided.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints: RoboHub Entrance isn't listed here, but maybe it's a common term. Wait, in the examples, there was a mention of RoboHub, so perhaps the user is referring to that. Alternatively, \"ark reactor\" might be a specific place not listed, or maybe they made a typo.\n\nI should check if any waypoints match \"ark reactor.\" But from the data given, I don't see any such waypoint. The closest I have are places like C&D - Coffee Area, Shower B, etc. So, it's possible that \"ark reactor\" isn't recognized here.\n\nSince the user is asking to go there and then find it, but it doesn't exist in my database, I need to respond accordingly. According to the instructions, if a waypoint isn't found, I should output an action where I speak saying it doesn't exist.\n\nSo, I'll construct an actions array with one speak action informing them that \"ark reactor\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
