    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by normalizing the input. The user is asking to go to two specific showers in sequence and wait at the second one.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there's a \"Shower A\" with coordinates (x: ?, y:?\u2014actually, wait, looking back, the provided waypoints don't include Shower A or B. Hmm, that might be an issue.)\n\nWait, let me check again. The user mentioned Shower A and Shower B. From the initial data, I see:\n\n- \"Shower A\" isn't listed among the available waypoints. Let me double-check the list.\n\nThe provided waypoints are:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - D Area\n- ... (others)\nWait no, looking back at the user's message, they listed several waypoints including Shower A but without coordinates? Or was it in another part?\n\nWait, no, in the initial data dump after # Waypoints, the user listed various points like \"C&D - Coffee Area\", \"Dining Hall - East Wing\", etc., but I don't see any Shower A or B.\n\nSo when the user says \"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\", these aren't present in the waypoint list. Therefore, according to the instructions, if a waypoint isn't found, we should return an action that speaks the error message.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a mistake here because maybe Shower A is indeed a waypoint but wasn't listed correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's initial message, they provided waypoints with their names and coordinates. Let me check again:\n\nThe list includes:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- Dinning Hall - East Wing\n- Library - Main Entrance\n- Laboratory - Robotics Section\n- Medical Bay - Trauma Room 1427\n- Gymnasium - Weightlifting Zone\n- Office Building - Executive Suite\n- Conference Hall - Auditorium\n\nWait, no Shower A or B. So, the user is trying to go to two showers that don't exist in the provided waypoints.\n\nSo according to the handling of unknown waypoints, I need to return a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the response should be an error message stating that \"Shower A\" (or whichever) isn't a valid waypoint. However, since both Shower A and B are missing, but in the prompt, the user first asks for Shower A, then Shower B, I need to process each step.\n\nBut wait, the processing is left-to-right. So the first command is to navigate to Shower A. Since it's unknown, we return an error. Then, perhaps after that, proceed? But according to the rules, if any part of the command is invalid, we output the speak action with the error and don't proceed further.\n\nSo the overall actions would be just one speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
