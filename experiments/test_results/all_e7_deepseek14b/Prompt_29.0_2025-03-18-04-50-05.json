    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user prompt: \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Go to the C&D.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the user is asking about the number of entrances to \"E7,\" but then they also tell me to go to \"C&D.\" The system needs to process these two parts: the question and the command.\n\nI know from the provided waypoint data that there are several entries related to entrances. Looking at the list, I see \"Shower B\" is under East Side, and others like \"Shower A\" aren't listed here but were in previous examples. But wait, maybe the user is referring to different areas or rooms.\n\nWait, the available waypoints include \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" which might be what the user meant by \"C&D.\" So the command part seems clear: navigate to C&D.\n\nBut the first part of their message is a question about entrances to E7. Since E7 isn't listed as a waypoint here, I can't provide specific information on its entrances. The system's rules say that if a waypoint doesn't exist, it should speak saying so.\n\nSo, the response needs to address both parts. First, acknowledge that \"E7\" isn't a known waypoint with the speak action. Then, proceed with navigating to C&D as per the command.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions would be: first, speak about E7 not being found, then navigate to C&D.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
