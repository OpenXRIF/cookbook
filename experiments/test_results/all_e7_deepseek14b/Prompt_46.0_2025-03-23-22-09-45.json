For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down what the user is asking. The prompt says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" \n\nFirst, I need to process each part of this command step by step. The first action is navigating to the E5 Entrance. Looking at the waypoints provided, there's an E5 Entrance located at coordinates (1535, 1535). So that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, after reaching E5 Entrance, the user wants to find the Microwaves. Now, looking through the list of waypoints, I don't see any mention of a \"Microwave\" or related terms. The available C&D areas have coffee, tea, etc., but no microwaves listed.\n\nSo, the second part of the command is problematic because there's no such waypoint as Microwaves. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint isn't recognized, I should return an error message using the speak action.\n\nI need to make sure that each step is processed in order. Since navigating to E5 Entrance is valid, but then finding Microwaves isn't, I have to handle this correctly. However, since the second part is invalid, perhaps the whole command becomes invalid because it includes an unknown waypoint.\n\nWait, no\u2014the first action is valid, so maybe I should still perform that navigation and then inform about the invalid second step. But looking at the example given, when a waypoint is unknown, it just returns a speak action with the error message, not including previous actions.\n\nBut in this case, the user wants to travel to E5 Entrance first and then find microwaves. Since finding microwaves isn't possible, perhaps the entire command should result in an error because one of the waypoints doesn't exist. However, since the first part is valid, but the second isn't, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user's instruction includes two steps: go to E5 Entrance and then find Microwaves. Since the second step refers to a non-existent waypoint, perhaps the whole command should be considered invalid because it includes an unknown component. Alternatively, perform the first valid action and then inform about the error in the second.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if any part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, return a single speak action with an error message. So maybe the entire prompt results in an error because one part is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me check: The user's instruction has two parts\u2014traveling to E5 Entrance (valid) and then finding microwaves (invalid). Since these are sequential actions, if the first is valid but the second isn't, should I proceed with the first action or treat the whole command as invalid?\n\nLooking at the example where the prompt included \"unknown zone,\" the response was a speak action indicating the error. So perhaps in this case, since the second part is invalid, the entire command is considered invalid, and only the error message is returned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should process the first valid action and then inform about the second. But according to the guidelines, if any part is invalid, return an error message without executing further actions.\n\nHmm, I think it's safer to follow the example where the entire command was deemed invalid because one part was unknown. Therefore, in this case, since \"find microwaves\" doesn't correspond to any known waypoint, the response should be a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
