    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Let's check out the Novelties store, and then head out the South Entrance.\" First, I should parse this sentence and identify the key components.\n\nI know that the system can navigate, speak, or wait. It starts at (0,0), so any navigation needs to go to a specific waypoint. The user mentioned two places: \"Novelties store\" and \"South Entrance.\"\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided earlier, I don't see \"Novelties store.\" There's no entry for that in the list, which includes various C&D areas and entrances like South Entrance.\n\nSo first, when the user says to check out the Novelties store, the system doesn't recognize it as a valid waypoint. According to the instructions, if an unknown waypoint is mentioned, the system should respond with a speak action saying it doesn't exist.\n\nSince \"Novelties store\" isn't recognized, the first step would be for the system to inform the user that this waypoint doesn't exist. After that, maybe the user can provide more information or correct their request.\n\nBut wait, what if the Novelties store is another name for one of the existing waypoints? The fuzzy matching process could help here. Let's see: \"Novelties\" might be a misspelling or alternative name for something else, but looking at the list provided, I don't see any similar names. So it's likely that it doesn't match anything.\n\nTherefore, the system should first handle the unknown waypoint by speaking the error message. Then, since the second part of the command is to go to the South Entrance, which does exist, after correcting or if the user provides more info, the system can navigate there.\n\nBut in this case, because the first part is invalid, maybe the system only responds with the speak action and doesn't proceed further. Alternatively, perhaps it navigates to South Entrance after informing about Novelties store not existing.\n\nHowever, according to the examples given, if a waypoint is unknown, the system should return just the speak action without proceeding with other commands. So in this prompt, since \"Novelties store\" isn't recognized and there's another valid waypoint, I think the correct response would be to first inform about the invalid waypoint.\n\nWait, but the user provided two steps: go to Novelties store and then South Entrance. If the first is invalid, maybe the system should handle that first before moving on.\n\nSo in this case, since the first part is unknown, the system's actions should only include speaking the error message about the Novelties store not existing, as per the instructions for handling unknown waypoints.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
