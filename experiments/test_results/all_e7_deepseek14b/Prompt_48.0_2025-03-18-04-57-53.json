    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to respond to this prompt. The user wants me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. First, I need to break down each part of the command.\n\nStarting with \"Travel to the E5 Entrance.\" From the provided waypoints, there's an E5 Entrance listed. So, I should navigate there first. Next, after reaching E5, the user wants me to find the Microwaves. Looking at the list, I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves\" or anything similar. That means it's an unknown waypoint.\n\nSince the second part of the command is invalid, the system should respond by informing the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint isn't recognized, we return a speak action with an error message.\n\nSo, the actions would be: first navigate to E5 Entrance as it exists, then check for Microwaves and since it's unknown, output the speak action about the invalid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 243,\n        \"y\": 187\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
