    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this user prompt: \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay\". Let me try to figure out how to process this step by step.\n\nFirst off, the user is giving me two main tasks. The first is to navigate to \"c&d\" and ask for a coffee. The second is to go to the \"design team bay\". I need to break this down into actions using the functions available: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\nOkay, starting with the normalization step as per the instructions. The user's input is \"Go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay\". Let me convert that to lowercase to make it easier to process: \"go to the c&d and ask for a coffee then go to the design team bay\".\n\nNext, I need to remove any extraneous tokens. Looking at this, there's no building code or non-essential identifier in the input, so I can skip that step.\n\nNow, tokenizing both the user input and the known waypoints. The user's commands are split into parts: \"c&d\" and \"design team bay\". The available waypoints include names like \"C&D - Coffee Area\", \"Design Team Bay\", etc.\n\nFor similarity calculation, I have to check if each token from the waypoint names appears in the user's input. Let's start with \"c&d\". In the user's input, it's \"c&d\" without the spaces, so when tokenized, it might be considered as one token or split into \"c\", \"&\", \"d\"? Hmm, but in the waypoint list, it's listed as \"C&D - Coffee Area\". So I think that after normalization, \"c&d\" would match \"c&d\" without issues.\n\nLooking at the waypoints:\n- \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is one option. The tokens are \"c\", \"&\", \"d\", \"coffee\", \"area\". The user's input has \"c&d\", which matches the first part, and then asking for coffee aligns with the second token.\n\nThen, the next part is \"design team bay\". The known waypoint is \"Design Team Bay\". When normalized to lowercase, it becomes \"design team bay\". So that should match exactly.\n\nSo each command in the user's prompt maps directly to a known waypoint. Therefore, no issues here; both waypoints exist.\n\nNow, structuring the response. The user wants to first navigate to c&d, ask for coffee, then go to design team bay. Since these are two separate navigations with an action in between (speaking), I'll need to list them in order.\n\nWait, but do I need to include the speak action right after navigating? Yes, because after arriving at C&D Coffee Area, the user wants to ask for coffee. Then, once that's done, navigate to Design Team Bay.\n\nSo the actions array will first have a navigate to \"C&D - Coffee Area\", then a speak action asking for coffee, followed by another navigate to \"Design Team Bay\".\n\nI don't see any invalid or ambiguous commands here, and all actions are supported. So I can proceed without errors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Can I have a coffee please?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Design Team Bay\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
