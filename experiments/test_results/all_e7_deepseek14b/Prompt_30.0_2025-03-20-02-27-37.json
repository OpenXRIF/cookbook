For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7.

    "Prompt": "\"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Also, Go to the C&D\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt: \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Also, Go to the C&D.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the starting point, the robot is at (0, 0). The user has given a command with two parts: an inquiry about E7 entrances and a directive to go to C&D.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7.\" I know that in our waypoint list, E7 isn't listed. So when the robot processes this, it should recognize that E7 doesn't exist as a waypoint. Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nNext, the second part of the command: \"Go to the C&D.\" I need to figure out which waypoint matches \"C&D\". Looking at our waypoints, there are several in the C&D area, like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Cold Drink, etc. The robot should use fuzzy matching to determine the most likely match. Since all these waypoints start with \"C&D\", and the user just said \"C&D\" without specifics, the robot might choose one based on the highest similarity or default to a primary one.\n\nNow, considering that the first part is an inquiry and the second is a command, the robot should process them in order. However, since the first part is invalid, it needs to respond to that before moving on. But wait, does the robot need to handle both parts separately? Or should it prioritize the valid command?\n\nIn this case, the user started with an inquiry but then gave a clear instruction. The robot might process each action in sequence. So, it would first attempt to find entrances for E7 (which doesn't exist), respond accordingly, and then proceed to navigate to C&D.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example provided, when there's an invalid waypoint, the robot just speaks about it not existing without processing further actions. However, in this case, after the invalid part, there is a valid command. So should the robot first speak about E7 not existing and then proceed to navigate to C&D? Or treat them as separate commands?\n\nI think the correct approach is to process each part of the command sequentially. First, handle the inquiry by speaking that E7 doesn't exist. Then, since \"Go to the C&D\" is a valid command, it should navigate there.\n\nBut in the response structure, actions are listed in order. So the robot would first speak about E7 and then navigate to C&D. Alternatively, if the invalid part is an inquiry, perhaps the robot only responds once with the error message and doesn't proceed further, but that might not make sense here since the user also gave a valid instruction.\n\nWait, no. The user said \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Also, Go to the C&D.\" So it's two separate requests within one sentence. The robot needs to process both. However, since the first part is invalid, it should respond with an error message and perhaps not proceed with the second command, or perhaps ignore the first part and focus on the valid command.\n\nBut looking at the examples provided, in the case where there's a mix of valid and invalid parts, the robot might prioritize the invalid one and stop processing further actions. However, in this case, maybe it should handle each part appropriately: speak about E7 not existing, and then navigate to C&D.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, when the user asked to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the robot only spoke once with the error message. So perhaps if any part of the command is invalid, the robot stops and just speaks about it.\n\nBut in this case, the first part is a question and the second is a command. It's a bit ambiguous. Maybe the best approach is to process each part as separate actions. First, check E7, which doesn't exist, so speak that. Then, regardless of that, proceed with navigating to C&D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps treat it as one command where both parts are processed: first, the inquiry (invalid), and then the navigation (valid). So in the response, you have two actions: the speak for E7 not existing, and then navigate to C&D.\n\nBut looking at the example where the user said \"Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub,\" the robot only responded with a single speak action indicating the error. It didn't proceed further because the first part was invalid.\n\nSo perhaps in this case, since the first part is an inquiry that's invalid, the robot should respond once and not process the second command. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to treat them as separate parts: acknowledge E7's non-existence and then proceed with the valid command.\n\nAlternatively, if the user says two things in one prompt, perhaps both need to be addressed. So first, answer the question (speak about E7 not existing), then execute the command (navigate to C&D). That makes sense because it handles all parts of the user's message.\n\nSo putting it together, the response would have two actions: a speak message about E7, and then a navigate action to C&D. But in the example provided earlier, when an invalid waypoint was part of the command, only the error message was given without further processing.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user's prompt is essentially two separate requests within one sentence. So the robot should process them accordingly: first, respond to the inquiry about E7 by saying it doesn't exist, and then proceed with the command to go to C&D. Therefore, the response would include both actions.\n\nSo in terms of structure, the JSON would have two \"speak\" actions? Wait, no, navigating is a separate action. So one speak message for the inquiry and another action (navigate) for the command.\n\nBut in the initial example, when the user asked to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the robot only spoke once with the error and didn't proceed further. But in this case, maybe since it's two separate parts, it can handle both.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The user's prompt is a single sentence with two clauses: \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7. Also, Go to the C&D.\" So they're connected by an 'also,' suggesting they are part of the same command. Therefore, the robot might process both as a single flow.\n\nIn that case, since one part is invalid (E7), perhaps it should respond with an error and not proceed further. Alternatively, if the invalid part is just an inquiry, it could still execute the valid command.\n\nBut I think the safest approach is to recognize that E7 doesn't exist and inform the user, then proceed to navigate to C&D as a separate action. So the response would have two speak actions? No, because navigating is a different type of action.\n\nWait, in our system, actions are either speak or navigate. So for \"I wonder how many entrances there are to E7,\" the robot can't answer that question because it doesn't have data on E7's entrances. So it should respond by saying E7 isn't a valid waypoint. Then, for the second part, it navigates to C&D.\n\nSo in the response JSON, you'd have two actions: first, a speak message about E7 not existing, and then a navigate action to C&D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the robot should treat each part as separate intents. The first is an inquiry that can't be answered, so it speaks about it, and the second is a command, which is processed.\n\nSo in the response, you would have two entries: one speak message for E7, and another navigate action for C&D.\n\nI think that's how it should work.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **User Input Analysis:** The user prompt contains two parts: an inquiry about E7 entrances and a directive to go to C&D.\n\n2. **Processing the Inquiry:**\n   - \"E7\" is not listed in the waypoints, so it's invalid.\n   - The robot responds by speaking that E7 isn't a valid waypoint.\n\n3. **Processing the Directive:**\n   - \"Go to the C&D\" refers to one of the valid C&D waypoints.\n   - Using fuzzy matching, the robot identifies the appropriate C&D waypoint and navigates there.\n\n4. **Response Structure:**\n   - First action: Speak about E7 not existing.\n   - Second action: Navigate to the identified C&D waypoint.\n\n**Response JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"speak\": \"I'm sorry, but E7 is not a valid waypoint.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"navigate\": {\n        \"destination\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
