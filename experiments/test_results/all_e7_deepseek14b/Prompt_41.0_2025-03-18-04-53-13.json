    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember from the guidelines that when processing a command, I should first check if there are any known waypoints matching the input. The user mentioned \"E7 silent study,\" so I need to see if there's a waypoint with something similar.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, I see several C&D areas like Coffee Area, Silent Study (I think), but wait, in the list given, I don't see an E7 waypoint. There are entries for E7 and E6 as part of the Waypoints, but when I look back, it seems they were mentioned as part of the initial setup but not in the detailed waypoint descriptions.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the user's initial message, they provided a list of waypoints under \"Waypoints\" section. Let me check that again. The Waypoints listed include various C&D areas like Coffee Area, Silent Study, etc., but I don't see E7 anywhere. Hmm.\n\nSo when the user says \"E7 silent study,\" I need to process this using the advanced fuzzy matching steps. First, normalize both inputs: the user's input is \"e7 silent study\" and each waypoint name is already lowercase in the data.\n\nNext, remove extraneous tokens. The user's input starts with \"e7\", which might be a building code or identifier. According to the guidelines, if a token has both letters and digits and appears at the beginning, it should be removed. So I'd take out \"e7\" from the user's input.\n\nThat leaves me with \"silent study.\" Now, split this into tokens: [\"silent\", \"study\"]. Then, compare against each waypoint name.\n\nLooking through the waypoints:\n- C&D - Coffee Area has tokens like coffee, area.\n- C&D - Silent Study has silent, study. That seems to match exactly.\n- Other waypoints don't have both silent and study.\n\nSo the similarity calculation would check if all tokens of the waypoint are present in the user's input after processing. In this case, \"silent\" and \"study\" are both present. So the C&D - Silent Study matches perfectly.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently navigate to that waypoint without any issues.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Silent Study\",\n                \"x\": 1286.0,\n                \"y\": 843.0\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
