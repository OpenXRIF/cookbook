    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this prompt where someone is asking to be guided back from the Microwaves to the E5 Entrance. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Microwaves. But looking at the waypoints provided, there isn't a \"Microwaves\" listed. So that's an issue because I can't find the location they're referring to. Next, the destination is E5 Enterance (I notice there might be a typo here, maybe it's supposed to be \"Entrance\"). Checking the waypoints, I see \"E5 Enterance\" as one of them.\n\nSince the starting location isn't recognized, I can't process this request further. My system needs to inform the user that the waypoint they mentioned doesn't exist. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint is unknown, I should return an action where I speak and say it doesn't exist.\n\nI don't have information about the Microwaves as a valid waypoint, so my response will be to inform them of this issue.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Starting Location:** The user mentions starting at the \"Microwaves.\" Checking the provided waypoints, there is no entry for \"Microwaves,\" making it an invalid starting point.\n\n2. **Destination Check:** The destination mentioned is the \"E5 Enterance,\" which exists in the waypoints but with a possible typo (should be \"Entrance\").\n\n3. **Validation:** Since the starting location isn't recognized, the system cannot proceed to navigate or perform any actions.\n\n4. **Response:** The system will respond by informing the user that the waypoint does not exist.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
