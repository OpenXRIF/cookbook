For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 4.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this prompt: \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is giving a command that involves navigating from one location to another. The starting point is the South Entrance, and the destination is the C&D - Coffee Area. \n\nI'll start by checking if both waypoints exist in the provided list. Looking through the data:\n\n- South Entrance: Yes, it's listed as E5 Entrance with coordinates (1535, 1535). Wait, no\u2014actually, looking back, I see that \"E5 Entrance\" is a waypoint, but \"South Entrance\" isn't explicitly named. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the South Entrance is another name for E5 Entrance? Or maybe it's referring to a different entrance not listed here.\n\nWait, the user said \"South Entrance,\" but in the provided waypoints, I don't see an exact match. The closest is E5 Entrance located at (1535, 1535), which might be the South Side. Maybe that's the intended starting point.\n\nNext, the destination is C&D - Coffee Area. Looking through the waypoints, there are several C&D areas: Coffee, Pastry, etc. The exact name \"C&D - Coffee Area\" exists with coordinates (100, 100).\n\nSo, I need to process this command. The user starts at South Entrance and navigates to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut wait, in the provided waypoint data, is there a South Entrance? Let me check again. Scanning through, E5 Entrance is at (1535, 1535), which might be on the south side. Maybe that's what they mean by South Entrance.\n\nIf so, then the actions would involve navigating from E5 Entrance to C&D - Coffee Area. But if South Entrance isn't a defined waypoint, I need to handle that error.\n\nWait, in the example given earlier, when the user mentioned \"C and D areas,\" it was matched to C&D - Coffee Area. So perhaps here, \"South Entrance\" is intended as E5 Entrance or another entrance not listed, but for now, let's proceed assuming South Entrance exists or is equivalent to E5.\n\nAlternatively, if South Entrance isn't a valid waypoint, the system should respond with an error message. But in this case, since the user provided both waypoints and one of them (C&D - Coffee Area) is valid, I'll assume that South Entrance is either correctly named or that E5 Entrance is considered the starting point.\n\nSo the actions would be: first navigate to C&D - Coffee Area from the starting point. Wait, but the command says \"start at\" so perhaps it's implying movement. But since the user is telling me where to start, maybe I don't need a navigation action for that unless there's an initial position given.\n\nWait, looking back, in the problem statement, the starting locations are (0,0), not South Entrance. So perhaps the command implies moving from (0,0) to South Entrance first and then to C&D - Coffee Area? Or is \"start at\" implying that I should begin there without needing a navigate action?\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial position is (0,0). The user's instruction is to start at South Entrance, so perhaps the first action is to navigate from (0,0) to South Entrance. Then, navigate from there to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut wait, in the example given earlier where the command was \"go to RoboHub,\" the response included a single navigate action to RoboHub without mentioning starting at (0,0). So perhaps when the user says \"start at X and go to Y,\" it implies that we need to move from X to Y.\n\nBut in our case, the initial position is given as (0,0), so I think the first step would be to navigate to South Entrance if it's a valid waypoint. However, in the provided waypoints, South Entrance isn't listed\u2014only E5 Entrance at (1535, 1535). Maybe that's the intended starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps \"South Entrance\" is an alias for E5 Entrance. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate from initial position (0,0) to South Entrance/E5 Entrance.\n2. Then navigate from there to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut in the problem statement's starting locations, it's at (0,0), so perhaps the first step is to navigate to South Entrance if it exists, then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, if \"South Entrance\" isn't a valid waypoint, I should respond with an error. But since the user provided both waypoints and only one might be ambiguous, maybe I'll proceed assuming that South Entrance is a valid waypoint or else handle the error.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when the user says \"start at X,\" it's like setting the starting point for the journey, so perhaps we don't need to navigate there unless moving from (0,0) to X is required.\n\nBut given that the system starts at (0,0), if I'm told to start at South Entrance, I would need to move there first before going to C&D. But if South Entrance isn't a valid waypoint, then it's an error.\n\nIn this case, since E5 Entrance is listed as a waypoint but not explicitly called South Entrance, perhaps the user made a mistake in naming. Alternatively, maybe South Entrance is another name for E5.\n\nBut without explicit data, I might have to proceed with what's given. So if South Entrance isn't found, the system should notify the user that it's invalid. But since C&D - Coffee Area is valid, perhaps only South Entrance needs to be checked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting point is (0,0), and the command is to go directly from there to C&D - Coffee Area without needing to start at South Entrance. That might complicate things.\n\nWait, no\u2014the user explicitly said \"start at South Entrance,\" so I think it's necessary to navigate there first unless it's the same as (0,0).\n\nBut in the given data, the starting location is separate from any waypoints, so perhaps \"start at\" implies that the agent begins at South Entrance without moving. But since the system starts at (0,0), maybe it needs to move to South Entrance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"start at\" is just a way to set the context, and the actual movement is only to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The user's command is clear: start at South Entrance and go to C&D - Coffee Area. So in terms of actions, it would be two navigate actions: first from starting point (0,0) to South Entrance, then from there to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut if South Entrance isn't a valid waypoint, I should handle that error. However, since the problem doesn't specify handling invalid waypoints and focuses on the response when they are valid, perhaps I'll proceed assuming both are valid.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n1. Navigate from (0,0) to South Entrance.\n2. Then navigate from South Entrance to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut looking back, E5 Entrance is at (1535, 1535), which might be the intended South Entrance. So perhaps the first action is navigating there, then moving to C&D.\n\nAlternatively, if starting at South Entrance implies that we don't need a navigate action because it's already our position, but since the initial position is (0,0), I think a navigate action is needed.\n\nWait, no\u2014when you're told to start at a point, in programming terms, it might mean initializing your position there. So if the system starts at (0,0), and the command says \"start at South Entrance,\" perhaps we don't need a navigate action because we are setting our starting point to South Entrance without moving.\n\nBut that's not how navigation works; you have to move from one point to another. So I think it's better to model it as navigating from (0,0) to South Entrance first, then proceeding.\n\nHowever, if \"start at\" is just a command to begin the journey and not an actual movement, perhaps we can ignore the initial position and directly navigate to C&D - Coffee Area from wherever \"starting at\" implies.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:\n\n- User commands: start at South Entrance, go to C&D - Coffee Area.\n- Both waypoints need to be valid for a successful response.\n- If either is invalid, return an error message.\n\nSince in the provided data, C&D - Coffee Area is present but South Entrance isn't, perhaps the system should respond that South Entrance isn't found. But in the example given earlier, when the user mentioned \"C and D areas,\" it was matched to C&D - Coffee Area, so maybe the same applies here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's examples, in one case, the command was \"go to RoboHub\" and the response was a single navigate action. Another example had an invalid waypoint resulting in an error message. So perhaps if South Entrance isn't found, the system should say it doesn't exist.\n\nBut since in this specific prompt, both waypoints are given, I'll assume that South Entrance is valid or proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"South Entrance\" refers to E5 Entrance at (1535, 1535). So perhaps the first navigate action is from (0,0) to E5 Entrance, then from there to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement's starting locations, it's given as (0,0), so moving to another point would require a navigate action.\n\nIn any case, I think the best approach is to model the response as two navigate actions: first to South Entrance, then to C&D - Coffee Area. If either isn't found, return an error.\n\nBut since the problem seems to focus on valid responses when waypoints are correct, perhaps the answer should just include navigating from (0,0) to C&D - Coffee Area, ignoring the \"start at\" part unless it's necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"start at\" is redundant and we can directly go to C&D. But I think following the user's command as given is better.\n\nIn conclusion, the system should navigate first to South Entrance (if valid) then proceed to C&D - Coffee Area. If either isn't found, inform the user accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe system will navigate from its starting position at coordinates (0,0) to the specified waypoints based on the user's command.
