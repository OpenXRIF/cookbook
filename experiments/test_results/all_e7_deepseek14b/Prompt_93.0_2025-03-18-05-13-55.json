    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user has given me this query where I'm supposed to act as an assistant for a robot navigating through waypoints. The prompt says, \"Robot, proceed to Elevators and say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the command. The main actions here are navigating to a location called \"Elevators\" and speaking once there.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, I check if \"Elevators\" is among them. Scanning through the list: RoboHub Entrance, C&D Coffee Area, etc., but no mention of an \"Elevators\" waypoint. \n\nNext step is to apply fuzzy matching as per the guidelines. Normalize both the input and the known waypoints by converting to lowercase. The user's input is \"elevators\", which doesn't match any waypoint names exactly. I also remove any extraneous tokens, but since there are none here, it stays.\n\nTokenizing both inputs, \"elevators\" vs each waypoint name, none of them share all the tokens needed for a high similarity score. So, no known waypoints meet the threshold. \n\nTherefore, according to the rules, if no waypoint matches, I should return an action where the robot speaks indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
