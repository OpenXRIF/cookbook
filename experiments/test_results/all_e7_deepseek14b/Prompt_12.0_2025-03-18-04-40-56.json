    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this command step by step. The user is giving a series of instructions that involve navigation and waiting. So, the first action should be navigating to the elevators. Then, after arriving, wait for 15 seconds. After that, navigate to the East Entrance.\n\nBut wait, looking at the provided waypoints, I don't see an \"Elevators\" waypoint listed. There are entries like \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic,\" \"South Entrance,\" etc., but no elevators mentioned. So, when the user mentions \"the Elevators,\" the system needs to check if this is a recognized waypoint.\n\nUsing the advanced fuzzy matching steps: normalization would convert both inputs to lowercase. The user's input is \"elevators.\" The system checks against all waypoints in lowercase. If none match closely enough based on token similarity, it won't find a match.\n\nIn that case, the system should respond by speaking, indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. Since the first part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire plan can't be executed as intended. Therefore, the response should inform the user about the invalid waypoint without proceeding further.\n\nSo, I need to structure the JSON response accordingly, using the \"speak\" action to inform the user that \"Elevators\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
