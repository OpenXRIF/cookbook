    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. The user has given me a specific prompt where the robot is instructed to go to \"[[Elevators]]\", say \"Elevators\" upon arrival, and then wait for five minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the command. The starting location is at (0,0), so the robot needs to navigate to [[Elevators]]. But looking at the waypoints provided, there isn't an \"[[Elevators]]\" listed. So my first thought is that this might be a waypoint not present in the given data.\n\nNext, I consider the user's instruction to \"say 'Elevators'\". This implies that after navigating, the robot should speak the word \"Elevators\". However, since the waypoint doesn't exist, the navigate action would fail. Therefore, the robot can't proceed with the navigation step because there's no corresponding waypoint.\n\nAdditionally, the command includes waiting for five minutes after meeting Zach in another example. But here, without a valid waypoint, the wait action is moot. The priority is to handle the invalid waypoint first.\n\nI should check if \"Elevators\" could match any existing waypoints through fuzzy matching. Let's see: the user input is \"elevators\", and we'll compare it against each waypoint name. None of the provided waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area\", \"Shower A\", etc., seem to relate to elevators. So, no match here.\n\nTherefore, the robot should respond by speaking that the waypoint doesn't exist, as per the instructions. There's no need to proceed further since the initial step (navigation) is invalid.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
