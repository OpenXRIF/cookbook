For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"We're at the Assembly Room now.

    "Prompt": "\"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this command. It seems like two actions: starting from the Assembly Room and navigating back to the Ideas Clinic.\n\nI should check if both waypoints exist in the provided list. Looking through the data:\n\n- The Assembly Room isn't directly listed, but there's an \"Assembly Room\" as one of the waypoints? Wait, no, looking again, I see \"Ideas Role\" and other roles but not \"Assembly Room.\" Wait, actually, yes, under the waypoints, there is an \"Assembly Room\" with coordinates (150, 100). \n\nWait, no, let me check again. The user provided a list of waypoints including \"Ideas Clinic,\" \"RoboHub,\" etc., but I don't see \"Assembly Room\" listed. Wait, perhaps it's under another name? Let me look.\n\nLooking back at the waypoint data:\n\n- Ideas Clinic: x=250, y=200\n- RoboHub: x=150, y=100\n- Other waypoints like C&D areas but not Assembly Room. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Wait, perhaps \"Assembly Room\" is another name for one of the existing waypoints? Or maybe it's a typo.\n\nWait, in the user's message, they're at the Assembly Room now. So if that's their current location, perhaps the system needs to recognize it as a valid waypoint. But in the provided data, I don't see \"Assembly Room\" listed. That might be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Assembly Room\" is another name for one of the existing waypoints. Let me think: perhaps it's referring to the \"Ideas Clinic\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe \"RoboHub\"? Unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the waypoints again:\n\nLooking at the list, I see waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Pastry Area,\" etc., but no \"Assembly Room.\" So if the user says they're at the Assembly Room, that might be an invalid waypoint.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, when navigating from C&D areas to RoboHub, it correctly identified the waypoints. So perhaps I should look again for any mention of Assembly Room.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Assembly Room\" is a different name or part of another waypoint's description. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they meant \"Ideas Clinic.\" But no, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system allows for fuzzy matching. The user might have meant \"Assembly Room\" as in a general area, but without exact matches, it's unclear.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\n1. Parse the command: two parts - current location and destination.\n2. Check if both locations are valid waypoints.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n\n- The Assembly Room isn't listed as a waypoint. So when the user says they're at the Assembly Room, that's an invalid waypoint unless it's a typo or alternative name.\n\nWait, maybe \"Assembly Room\" is part of another waypoint's description? Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the waypoints:\n\n- Ideas Clinic: 250,200\n- RoboHub:150,100\n- C&D - Coffee Area: (probably x=100,y=100 as per example)\n- North Entrance: x=0.0,y=0.0? No, starting point is 0,0.\n\nWait, perhaps the Assembly Room is a different waypoint not listed here. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for \"Assembly Area\" or another name.\n\nBut without more data, I have to assume that \"Assembly Room\" isn't a valid waypoint. Therefore, when the user says they're at the Assembly Room, the system should recognize it as invalid.\n\nIn that case, the response would be to speak an error message: \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, when navigating from C&D areas to RoboHub, the system correctly identified both waypoints. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Assembly Room\" is a valid waypoint that wasn't listed in the initial data. Wait, no, the user only provided specific waypoints, so unless it's part of them, I can't assume it exists.\n\nTherefore, if the user says they're at the Assembly Room and wants to go back to Ideas Clinic, but Assembly Room isn't recognized, the system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, in the initial prompt, the starting location is 0.0,0.0, which might be considered as a valid point, but not a named waypoint.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to structure this:\n\n- The user's command implies two actions: being at Assembly Room and moving to Ideas Clinic.\n- Check if both are valid waypoints.\n\nFrom the data:\n\n- Ideas Clinic is present (250,200).\n- Assembly Room isn't listed as a waypoint.\n\nTherefore, when the system receives the command, it should check if \"Assembly Room\" exists. Since it doesn't, it would respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nBut in the example given by the user earlier, they navigated from C&D areas to RoboHub without issues, so perhaps I need to apply similar logic here.\n\nWait, but in this case, both parts of the command are about movement: starting at Assembly Room and moving to Ideas Clinic. If the system doesn't recognize Assembly Room, it can't process the command.\n\nSo, the response should be an error message indicating that Assembly Room isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\nThe user's command involves two waypoints: \"Assembly Room\" and \"Ideas Clinic.\" Upon checking the provided data:\n\n1. **Ideas Clinic** is a valid waypoint with coordinates (250, 200).\n2. **Assembly Room** is not listed as a valid waypoint.\n\nSince \"Assembly Room\" isn't recognized, the system should inform the user that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n\n**Response:**\n```\nThis waypoint does not exist.\n```",
