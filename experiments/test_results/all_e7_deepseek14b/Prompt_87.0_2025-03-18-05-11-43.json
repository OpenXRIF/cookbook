    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the user's prompt step by step. The command given is: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify any known waypoints from the provided list. Looking through the data, I see waypoints like South Entrance, RoboHub Entrance, etc., but there's no mention of a Temporary Booth. This means the waypoint doesn't exist in our system.\n\nNext, since the command includes an unsupported action beyond navigate, speak, or wait, specifically waiting for 30 minutes, which isn't covered by our available functions as per the guidelines, I should handle this appropriately. \n\nI realize that the primary issue is the non-existent waypoint and the invalid function (waiting beyond the allowed parameters). According to the instructions, if any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait is requested, we return a speak action indicating an unsupported action.\n\nTherefore, the response should inform the user about the unsupported action and possibly mention the unknown waypoint. However, since the main issue here is the action, I'll focus on that in the output.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
