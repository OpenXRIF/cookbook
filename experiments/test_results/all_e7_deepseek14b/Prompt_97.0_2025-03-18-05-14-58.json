    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt where they're asking the robot to move to [[Assembly Room]], state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival, and wait for confirmation before proceeding. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is using a specific syntax with double brackets around \"Assembly Room\". From the examples provided, it looks like waypoints are usually in quotes or mentioned without such brackets. So I should check if the robot recognizes \"Assembly Room\" as a valid waypoint.\n\nLooking at the list of available waypoints, none are named \"Assembly Room\". The closest ones are things like Shower A, various C&D areas, and others. Since \"Assembly Room\" isn't listed, it's an invalid waypoint.\n\nThe next part is the command structure: move to the location, state upon arrival, then wait for confirmation. This suggests a sequence of actions\u2014navigate, speak, wait. But since the initial navigation is impossible because the waypoint doesn't exist, the entire chain breaks down.\n\nI should return an error message indicating that 'Assembly Room' isn't a valid waypoint. According to the guidelines, if there's an invalid command, I need to output a single speak action with an error message.\n\nSo, the response will be to inform the user that \"Assembly Room\" doesn't exist and stop processing further actions since the initial step fails.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
