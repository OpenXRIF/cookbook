For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"We're at the Assembly Room now.

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this user prompt where they say, \"We're at the Assembly Room now. Let's head back to the Ideas Clinic.\" My job is to figure out how to respond with the appropriate actions.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the command. The user is indicating their current location as the Assembly Room and wants to move to the Ideas Clinic. That means there are two waypoints involved here: \"Assembly Room\" and \"Ideas Clinic.\"\n\nI should check if both of these are valid waypoints in the system. From the data provided, I can see that \"Ideas Clinic\" is listed with its coordinates, but wait\u2014actually, looking back, I realize that the waypoints include \"Assembly Room\"? Hmm, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the list doesn't explicitly mention an \"Assembly Room.\" Let me go through each waypoint:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - Pastry Area\n- C&D - Pastry\n- C&D - Pastry Area\n- Ideas Clinic\n- RoboHub\n- etc.\n\nI don't see an \"Assembly Room\" listed. That might be a problem because if the system doesn't recognize the starting point, it can't proceed correctly.\n\nSo when the user says they're at the Assembly Room, the system needs to check if that's a valid waypoint. Since it isn't, the system should respond by informing the user of this issue.\n\nIn such cases, according to the guidelines, if an unknown waypoint is mentioned, the system should output a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the response should be a single speak action telling the user that \"Assembly Room\" isn't recognized. It's important to handle this early because without knowing where they are, navigating elsewhere isn't possible.\n</think>\n\nThe user has indicated their current location as the Assembly Room and wants to move to the Ideas Clinic. However, since \"Assembly Room\" is not a valid waypoint in our system, we need to inform them of this issue.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Starting Point:** The user mentions being at the Assembly Room, which isn't listed as a valid waypoint.\n2. **Check Validity:** Since the starting location isn't recognized, navigation is impossible.\n3. **Respond Appropriately:** Inform the user about the invalid starting point.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
