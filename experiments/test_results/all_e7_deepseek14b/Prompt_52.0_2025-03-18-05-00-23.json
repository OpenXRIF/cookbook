    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user said, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify each part of the command. There are two actions here: traveling to the E5 Entrance and then finding the Microwaves. \n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, I see that there's an \"E5 Entrance\" listed. So that's valid. But what about \"Microwaves\"? Scanning through the list, I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" The available waypoints include various entrances and specific areas like South Entrance, C&D Coffee Area, etc., but no mention of microwaves.\n\nSince \"E5 Entrance\" exists, the first action is clear: navigate there. However, the second part asks to find the Microwaves, which isn't a recognized waypoint. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an error message. \n\nI also need to make sure that I handle multiple steps correctly. The user specified two actions in sequence, so ideally, I would navigate to E5 first and then try to find Microwaves. But since Microwaves isn't recognized, the entire command after that point is invalid.\n\nIn this case, it's better to inform the user that the second waypoint doesn't exist rather than proceeding partially. This avoids confusion and ensures the user knows exactly where the problem lies.\n\nSo, my response should be an action that speaks the error message about the Microwaves not existing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
