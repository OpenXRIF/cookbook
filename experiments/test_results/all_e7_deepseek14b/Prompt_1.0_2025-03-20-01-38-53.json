For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic.

    "num_waypoints_injected": 20,
    "Data Set": "E7-1",
    "Experiment ID": 1.0,
    "Prompt ID": 1.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this prompt: \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is giving a sequence of two navigation commands. The first is to go to the North Entrance, and the second is to proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance. My job is to process these instructions according to the provided guidelines.\n\nStarting with the normalization step: I need to convert both the waypoint names and the user's input into lowercase. So, \"North Entrance\" becomes \"north entrance\", and \"C&D - Main Entrance\" becomes \"c&d main entrance\".\n\nNext, I have to remove any extraneous tokens, especially those that might be building codes or non-essential identifiers. For example, if a waypoint name has something like \"E5\" at the beginning, I should remove it because it's probably not part of the main name.\n\nThen, tokenization comes into play. I split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words. So, \"north entrance\" becomes [\"north\", \"entrance\"], and \"c&d main entrance\" becomes [\"c\", \"&\", \"d\", \"main\", \"entrance\"] after removing any extra tokens.\n\nNow, for similarity calculation. I check if every token from the waypoint names appears in the user's input or vice versa. Alternatively, a high percentage (like 80%) of the tokens should match. So, I look through all the known waypoints and see which ones have their tokens present in the user's input.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints provided, there isn't an exact \"North Entrance\". However, there is an E5 Entrance. Wait, but that's under South Side. There's no North Entrance listed. So, when I check for \"north entrance\", none of the waypoint names match exactly or with enough token similarity.\n\nThen, moving on to the second part: \"C&D - Main Entrance\". From the user input, after cleaning, it's \"c&d main entrance\". Looking at the waypoints, there is a C&D - Coffee Area, but that's not the same as an entrance. There might be other C&D areas like C&D - Main Entrance, but in the provided list, I don't see such a waypoint.\n\nSince neither of these waypoints exists in the database, both would fail the similarity check. Therefore, for each part of the command, since no matching waypoints are found, the system should respond by speaking that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, the actions would be two speak commands, one for each invalid waypoint mentioned. But according to the examples, if any part of the command is invalid, it returns a single speak action with an error message. Wait, looking back at the guidelines: if multiple waypoints are invalid, but in this case, both parts are invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should process each step separately. The first command is to go to North Entrance, which doesn't exist. So, the system would respond by speaking that it doesn't exist. Then, since the user didn't specify an alternative, maybe it stops there and doesn't proceed further with the second part because the first action already failed.\n\nAlternatively, if both waypoints are invalid, perhaps the system should return one error message indicating that the North Entrance is invalid and not proceed to the next command.\n\nWait, let me check the guidelines again. It says: \"If any function beyond 'navigate', 'speak', or 'wait' is requested...\" but in this case, it's about unknown waypoints. The example given was when a waypoint doesn't exist, return a speak action with the message.\n\nSo, for each part of the command, if it's invalid, we need to process them one by one and respond accordingly.\n\nBut the prompt here has two separate navigate commands: first North Entrance, then C&D - Main Entrance. If the first is invalid, the system speaks that it doesn't exist. Since the user didn't provide any other instructions, perhaps only the first error is needed.\n\nWait, but in the example where both waypoints are invalid, like \"unknown zone\" and RoboHub, the response was a single speak action with an error message about 'unknown zone'. So maybe if multiple waypoints are invalid, it just reports the first one and doesn't proceed further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each command is processed sequentially. Since the first one is invalid, the system speaks the error and stops, without processing the second command.\n\nIn this case, since both North Entrance and C&D - Main Entrance don't exist in the waypoints list, the system would process the first command, find it invalid, speak that it doesn't exist, and not proceed to the next one because the user might want to correct their input.\n\nTherefore, the response should be a single speak action indicating that \"North Entrance\" does not exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"command\": \"The waypoint 'north entrance' does not exist.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
