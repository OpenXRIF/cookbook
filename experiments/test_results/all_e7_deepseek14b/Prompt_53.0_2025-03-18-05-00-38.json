    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the user's command. It looks like there are two main actions here: navigating to the E5 Entrance first, and then finding the Microwaves. The user wants these actions to happen in sequence.\n\nNext, I need to check if both waypoints exist based on the provided list. From the data given, I see an \"E5 Entrance\" listed with coordinates (20, 10). So that's good; E5 is a valid waypoint. Now, looking for \"Microwaves,\" but in the list of waypoints, there isn't one explicitly named Microwaves. There are other areas like C&D Coffee Area, South Entrance, etc., but not Microwaves.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if \"Microwaves\" could be a part of another waypoint's description or perhaps an item within a location. However, based on the information provided, there's no waypoint named Microwaves. So this might fall under an unknown or invalid command.\n\nGiven that, according to the instructions, if a waypoint isn't recognized, I should return a speak action indicating it doesn't exist. But in this case, the user has two requests: first navigate to E5, then find Microwaves. Since E5 exists but Microwaves doesn't, how do I handle this?\n\nI think the correct approach is to process the first valid command and then inform about the second issue. However, looking at the supported edge cases, if any part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, we return a single speak action with an error message.\n\nBut wait, in the examples provided, when part of the command was invalid (like \"unknown zone\"), it resulted in a speak action with an error. So perhaps in this case, since the second part is invalid, I should return an error message instead of processing the first valid action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe process the first valid action and then inform about the second issue. However, according to the instructions, if any part is invalid or ambiguous, it's treated as an overall invalid command, leading to a speak action with the error.\n\nSo in this case, since \"Microwaves\" isn't a recognized waypoint, the entire command should result in an error message: \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nTherefore, I need to create an actions array that includes a single speak action with the appropriate input.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
