    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to handle this prompt step by step. So, the user is asking the robot to perform a series of tasks starting from the \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" and moving through several waypoints, ending back at the \"C&D - Coffee Area\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if all the waypoints mentioned exist in the provided list. The waypoints given are \"C&D - Hot Food Area\", \"RoboHub\", \"Ideas Clinic\", \"Assembly Room\", and \"C&D - Coffee Area\". From the initial data, I can see that \"C&D - Coffee Area\" is listed as one of the waypoints with specific coordinates. However, the other waypoints like \"C&D - Hot Food Area\", \"RoboHub\", \"Ideas Clinic\", and \"Assembly Room\" aren't present in the provided list.\n\nSince \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" isn't a recognized waypoint, according to the rules, I should return an error message indicating that this waypoint doesn't exist. This means the robot can't proceed further because it's missing critical information needed to fulfill the request.\n\nI also need to make sure that I'm following the instructions correctly regarding normalization and token removal. But in this case, since one of the waypoints is invalid, there's no need to process further actions beyond returning an error.\n\nSo, the robot should speak a message informing the user that \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" doesn't exist as a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
