    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to figure out how the user's message \"I could really go for a shower.\" should be processed. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned they want a shower, which implies they're looking for a location where they can take one. From the provided waypoints, there's one called \"shower\" but I need to check if that's an available waypoint.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints given:\n\n- Starting Locations: X=874.0, Y=613.0\n- Waypoints include various C&D areas like Coffee Area, RoboHub Entrance (if it exists), and others. Wait, actually in the data provided, I don't see a waypoint named \"shower.\" Let me review again.\n\nThe waypoints listed are:\n\n- Starting Locations: X=874.0, Y=613.0\n- Waypoints:\n  - C&D - Coffee Area\n  - C&D - RoboHub Entrance (I'm assuming this exists as per the example)\n  - Other C&D areas like Coffee, etc.\n\nWait, no, in the data provided earlier, I don't see a waypoint named \"shower.\" The available waypoints are all part of the C&D areas or specific to functions like coffee, hubs, etc. So if the user is asking about a shower, it's likely not listed as a separate waypoint but perhaps they're referring to a rest area or another location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user thinks that \"shower\" can be navigated by using one of the existing waypoints, but since it's not listed, it's an invalid request. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the waypoint isn't recognized, I should return a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. So in this case, since there's no shower listed among the available waypoints, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint does not exist.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following all the steps correctly: normalizing the input, removing extraneous tokens, tokenizing, calculating similarity, and then selecting or falling back. But in this case, \"shower\" doesn't match any existing waypoints after processing, so it's safe to conclude that it's an unknown waypoint.\n\nSo the output should be a single action where the assistant speaks, saying that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
