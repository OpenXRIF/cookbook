For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 52.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is giving a command with two parts: traveling to E5 Entrance and then finding the Microwaves. I need to check if both waypoints exist in the provided list.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints, I see \"E5 Entrance\" is listed as one of them. That's good. Now, for the second part, \"find the Microwaves.\" I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves\" in the list. The closest related areas might be the C&D areas where there are coffee, microwaves, etc., but they're specific like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" not a general \"Microwaves.\"\n\nSince \"Microwaves\" isn't listed as a separate waypoint, I can't navigate to it directly. According to the instructions, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an action that speaks informing the user about it.\n\nSo, my response would be to first navigate to E5 Entrance since it's valid. Then, after arriving, inform the user that \"Microwaves\" isn't a valid waypoint. Alternatively, maybe just speak right away if both parts are invalid, but in this case, only the second part is problematic.\n\nWait, no\u2014the prompt says to travel to E5 first and then find Microwaves. Since E5 exists, I can navigate there, but upon attempting the second step, I realize Microwaves isn't a valid waypoint. So perhaps after navigating to E5 Entrance, I should speak about the invalid request.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to process each command in order. First, navigate to E5, then attempt to find Microwaves. Since finding Microwaves fails, I can respond with an error message.\n\nBut looking at the examples, when an unknown waypoint is encountered, it returns a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So perhaps after the first navigation, the second step would trigger that response.\n\nWait, but in this case, the user's command has two steps: travel to E5 and then find Microwaves. Since both need to be processed, I should probably include the navigate action to E5 and then the speak action about the invalid waypoint.\n\nSo my actions array would have two entries: first navigate to E5 Entrance, then speak that \"Microwaves\" doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the second part is invalid. So perhaps after navigating to E5, I check for Microwaves and since it's not there, inform the user.\n\nBut in the instructions, when a waypoint is unknown, you just return a single speak action with the error message. But in this case, the user gave two commands: first navigate, then find. So perhaps I need to process both steps and handle the error at the second step.\n\nWait, but according to the handling of complex commands, they should be processed left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So first, I would perform the navigation to E5 Entrance, which is valid. Then, attempt to find Microwaves, which isn't a valid waypoint, so I have to speak that it doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, my response should include both actions: navigate to E5 and then speak about the invalid Microwaves.\n\nWait, but in the example given earlier, when an unknown zone was part of the command, only the speak action was returned. So perhaps if any step is invalid, the entire command is considered invalid? Or do I process each step individually?\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nIn one example, the user asked to go to the unknown zone and then RoboHub. The response was a single speak action saying \"invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint.\" So it seems that if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the whole thing becomes an error.\n\nBut in this case, the first part is valid (E5 Entrance), and the second isn't. So I think I should process each step as they come. That is, navigate to E5, then attempt to find Microwaves, which fails, so speak about it.\n\nSo my actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n2. Speak that \"Microwaves\" doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system expects only one action in such cases, but I think processing both steps makes sense since the first is valid and the second isn't.\n\nWait, but looking at the example where the user asked to go to unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was just a speak action. So maybe if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire command is considered invalid, regardless of other valid parts.\n\nIn that case, since \"find the Microwaves\" is invalid, the whole command should return the error message without processing the first step. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nTo clarify: in the example with unknown zone and RoboHub, the response was a single speak action indicating the invalid part. So perhaps for this prompt, only the second part is invalid, but since it's part of the command, the entire thing would be considered invalid, leading to just the speak action without navigating.\n\nBut I think that might not be correct because the first part is valid. However, in the example provided earlier, when both steps were given and one was invalid, only a single error message was returned. So maybe the system doesn't process further steps if any step is invalid.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should just return a speak action about the invalid waypoint, without navigating to E5 Entrance first.\n\nWait, but the command has two parts: navigate to E5 and then find Microwaves. If the second part is invalid, it's possible that the system would handle each step individually. So perhaps I can process the first valid navigation and then inform about the invalid second step.\n\nBut according to the instruction examples, when any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, it returns a single error message without processing further steps. For example, in the case where the user asked to go to unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was just a speak action about the unknown zone.\n\nSo perhaps in this case, since \"find Microwaves\" is invalid, the entire command should be considered invalid, leading to only the speak action without navigating to E5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should process each part as they come. So first navigate to E5, then attempt to find Microwaves and fail.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Let me check the instructions again: \"Handling complex commands: if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire command is considered invalid.\"\n\nWait, I think that's not explicitly stated, but in the example given earlier, when the user included an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was just a speak action about the unknown zone. So perhaps if any step is invalid, the whole command is considered invalid.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since \"find Microwaves\" isn't a valid waypoint, I should return a single speak action without processing the first part.\n\nWait, but E5 Entrance is a valid waypoint; it's listed. So maybe only the second part is invalid, and thus I can process the first step, then inform about the second.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step is processed individually. If that's the case, then after navigating to E5, I would attempt to find Microwaves and fail, leading to a speak action.\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, when an invalid waypoint was part of the command, only the error message was returned without processing the valid parts. So perhaps in this case, since \"find Microwaves\" is invalid, the entire command is considered invalid.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to navigate and then find; it's possible that each step should be processed in order, with errors being reported when they occur. So first navigate, which works, then attempt the second part, which fails, leading to an error message after the first action.\n\nIn that case, my response would include both actions: navigating to E5 Entrance and then speaking about Microwaves not existing.\n\nSo I think I should structure it as:\n\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n2. Speak about Microwaves being invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only one of these steps is possible before encountering the error. Let me see how the example was handled earlier.\n\nIn the example where the user wrote \"go to unknown zone and then RoboHub,\" the response was a single speak action without processing the first part. So perhaps in this case, since \"find Microwaves\" is invalid, I should return a speak action about it without navigating.\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain. To be safe, perhaps I should follow the example and only return an error if any part of the command is invalid, even if another part is valid. So in this case, since finding Microwaves isn't possible, I'll just return the speak action.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the user can navigate to E5 and then find other things within E5. Maybe \"find Microwaves\" refers to a specific area or item within E5, which might not be directly listed as a waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system expects me to handle each command in sequence: first process the navigation, then attempt the next step. So I would navigate to E5 Entrance and then, upon attempting to find Microwaves, realize it's invalid and inform the user.\n\nTherefore, my actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n2. Speak that \"Microwaves\" is not a valid waypoint.\n\nYes, that makes sense because each command part should be handled individually unless stated otherwise. So I'll include both actions in my response.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"intent\": \"INFORMATION\",\n  \"response\": {\n    \"action\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"NAVIGATE\",\n        \"payload\": {\n          \"location\": \"E5 Entrance\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"SPEAK\",\n        \"payload\": {\n          \"text\": \"The location 'Microwaves' is not a valid waypoint.\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
