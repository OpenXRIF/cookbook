    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this prompt where someone wants to be taken to \"E7 silent study.\" Let's break down how I would handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to match \"E7 silent study\" against the available waypoints. The user input is converted to lowercase: \"e7 silent study.\"\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, none of them exactly match this. I should check if any waypoint includes parts of this query. \n\nWait, there's an E7 listed as a starting location? No, looking back, the starting locations are (1500, 525), but not E7. The available waypoints include \"E Role,\" \"E and D Hubs,\" etc., but nothing with E7.\n\nSince no waypoint matches, I should respond that it doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user requested to be taken to \"E7 silent study.\" After checking the available waypoints, none match this query. Therefore, the response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
