For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user says, \"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" \n\nFirst, I notice that the user wants to go to two locations: Shower A and then Shower B. But looking back at the waypoints provided earlier, I see that there's a Shower A listed with coordinates (x=30, y=5). However, there's no mention of a Shower B in the available waypoints. \n\nSo, the first step is to process each part of the command. The user starts by asking to go to Shower A, which exists. But then they add that after that, they want to go to Shower B and wait for 1 minute there before proceeding.\n\nSince Shower B isn't listed as a valid waypoint, I need to handle this appropriately. According to the instructions, if an unknown waypoint is mentioned, I should return a speak action indicating it doesn't exist. However, in this case, the user provided multiple steps: first to Shower A, then to Shower B with a wait.\n\nI think the best approach is to process what's possible and inform about the missing part. So, navigate to Shower A as requested since it exists. Then, when trying to go to Shower B, since it doesn't exist, I should respond that it's unknown. But how do I structure this in actions?\n\nWait, the user included multiple steps in one command: first Shower A, then Shower B with a wait. So maybe I should handle each action sequentially but check if each waypoint is valid before executing.\n\nBut looking at the examples provided, when an invalid or ambiguous command is given, we return a single speak action with an error message. However, in this case, part of the command is valid (Shower A) and part isn't (Shower B). \n\nHmm, perhaps I should process the first valid action (navigate to Shower A) and then handle the invalid one by informing the user. But according to the instructions, if any step is invalid, we might need to return an error.\n\nWait, no. The instruction says that for unknown waypoints, return a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So perhaps I should process each part of the command as separate actions and check validity at each step.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's command includes multiple steps, but one is invalid, maybe we should only proceed with the valid parts up to the point where it fails. But in this case, Shower B doesn't exist, so after navigating to Shower A, the next action would be invalid.\n\nI think the correct approach here is to first attempt to navigate to Shower A since it's a valid waypoint. Then, when trying to navigate to Shower B, since it's unknown, we issue an error message. But according to the instructions, if multiple steps are given and one fails, perhaps we should return the error at that point.\n\nWait, no. The user's command is a single string with multiple actions: go to A, then B, wait, etc. So in processing this, each action is part of the same command, not separate commands. Therefore, if any step refers to an invalid waypoint, we should return an error at that point.\n\nLooking back at the instructions, under \"Handling Complex Commands,\" it says to process commands left-to-right unless stated otherwise and output actions in order. For ambiguous or invalid commands, return a speak action with an error message.\n\nSo in this case, since part of the command is invalid (Shower B), I should return that entire command is invalid, not just proceed up to Shower A. Therefore, the response would be to speak that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, the user's command includes two way points and a wait. If the first point is valid but the second isn't, do we process the first and then error? Or treat the entire command as invalid?\n\nI think in this case, since it's a single command string, if any part is invalid (like Shower B), the whole command should result in an error message. However, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each navigate action is treated separately, so first navigate to A, then attempt B and fail. But according to the example where the user asked for C and D areas and RoboHub, it handled both waypoints correctly because they existed.\n\nIn our case, since Shower B doesn't exist, I think the best approach is to process the valid part (Shower A) and then inform about the invalid part. But looking at the examples, when a waypoint is unknown, it's a single speak action as the response.\n\nWait, in the example where the user asked for \"unknown zone,\" the entire command was rejected with a speak action. So perhaps if any part of the command refers to an unknown waypoint, the whole thing is treated as invalid and a speak action is returned.\n\nIn that case, since the user's command includes Shower B which isn't a valid waypoint, the response should be a single speak action stating that the waypoint doesn't exist, without processing the first navigate to Shower A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the instructions again. The example where the user asked for multiple waypoints and both were valid was handled correctly. But when any part is invalid, it seems like the entire command should result in an error.\n\nTherefore, since Shower B isn't a valid waypoint, the response should be that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe user's request includes navigating to two locations: first Shower A and then Shower B, with a wait at Shower B. Since Shower B is not listed as a valid waypoint, the entire command cannot be fulfilled.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. The user requests navigation to Shower A followed by Shower B.\n2. Shower A exists in the waypoints, but Shower B does not.\n3. According to the instructions, if any part of the command refers to an unknown waypoint, the whole command is treated as invalid.\n4. Therefore, the system responds with a message indicating that Shower B doesn't exist.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe system responds by informing the user that Shower B is not recognized.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"speak\",\n  \"text\": \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n}\n```",
