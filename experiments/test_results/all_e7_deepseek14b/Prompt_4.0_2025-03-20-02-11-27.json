For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Experiment ID": 1.0,
    "Prompt ID": 4.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt. The user wrote: \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the starting location is given as South Entrance. Looking back at the waypoints provided, there's an E5 Entrance but not a South Entrance directly. Wait, no, I see E5 Entrance is listed with coordinates (1535, 1535) and it's under South Side. So maybe \"South Entrance\" refers to E5 Entrance? Or perhaps there's another waypoint called South Entrance that isn't listed here. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I don't see a waypoint named South Entrance. There's E5 Entrance, but that's labeled as Engineering 5. Maybe the user is referring to E5 Entrance as the starting point because it's on the south side. Alternatively, perhaps there's another entrance not listed in the waypoints provided.\n\nBut according to the given data, the only entrances are E5 and E5 Entrance. So maybe \"South Entrance\" is intended to be E5 Entrance. I'll proceed under that assumption unless told otherwise.\n\nNext, the destination is C&D - Coffee Area. Looking at the waypoints, there's a C&D - Coffee Area listed with specific coordinates (100, 100). That should be straightforward.\n\nSo the user wants to start at South Entrance (assumed as E5 Entrance) and navigate to C&D - Coffee Area. I need to create two actions: first, navigate from the starting point (which is (0,0)) to E5 Entrance, then from there to C&D - Coffee Area. Wait no, actually, the prompt says \"Start at the South Entrance\", which is a waypoint, so perhaps the initial location should be that waypoint's coordinates.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the starting locations are given as (0,0), but the user is telling me to start at South Entrance. So I think the first action would be to navigate from (0,0) to South Entrance, then proceed to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nBut wait, in the waypoint list, E5 Entrance has coordinates (1535, 1535). If that's intended as the South Entrance, then maybe the starting point is actually E5 Entrance. Alternatively, perhaps \"South Entrance\" isn't a waypoint and I need to inform the user of that.\n\nWait no, in the problem statement, the starting locations are given as (0,0), but the user is giving their own starting point. So the first step would be to navigate from (0,0) to South Entrance, but since South Entrance isn't a listed waypoint, I should check if it's another name for an existing one.\n\nLooking back at the waypoints, E5 Entrance is under the South Side and has coordinates. Maybe that's what the user means by South Entrance. So perhaps I can proceed with that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"South Entrance\" is a separate waypoint not listed here. But since it's not in the provided list, I might have to treat it as an unknown.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the starting locations are (0,0), and the user is giving their own starting point, so perhaps the first action is to navigate from (0,0) to South Entrance. If South Entrance isn't a recognized waypoint, then I should respond with an error message saying it doesn't exist.\n\nWait no, in the example given earlier, when the user says \"go to the unknown zone\", it returns an error. So if South Entrance is not a valid waypoint, I need to inform them.\n\nBut looking at the list again, there's E5 Entrance which is under South Side. Maybe the user intended that, but perhaps they referred to it as South Entrance. Alternatively, maybe South Entrance is another name for E5 Entrance.\n\nWait, in the waypoints, E5 Entrance is listed with coordinates (1535, 1535) and it's part of South Side. So if I'm supposed to navigate from there, but the starting point is given as (0,0), then maybe the first action is to go to E5 Entrance.\n\nWait no, the user says \"Start at the South Entrance\", which implies that the initial location is South Entrance, not (0,0). But according to the problem statement, the starting locations are fixed at (0,0). So perhaps the user is giving a different starting point, but in reality, I should still start from (0,0) and go to South Entrance.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me clarify:\n\n- The system starts at (0,0), but the user wants to \"start\" at South Entrance.\n- Therefore, the first action is to navigate from (0,0) to South Entrance.\n- If South Entrance isn't a valid waypoint, I need to return an error.\n\nBut in the given list of waypoints, there's no South Entrance. So perhaps it's a mistake or an alternative name for E5 Entrance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe South Entrance is intended to be another point not listed here. But since it's not present, I can't assume that. Therefore, the correct response would be to inform the user that South Entrance isn't recognized as a waypoint and provide suggestions based on similar names.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps E5 Entrance is close enough, so I might proceed with that, but ideally, I should ask for clarification.\n</think>\n\nThe user's request involves navigating from (0,0) to South Entrance and then to C&D - Coffee Area. However, since \"South Entrance\" isn't listed as a valid waypoint, the system cannot recognize it. Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform the user that South Entrance isn't recognized and offer possible alternatives.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Start Point:** The system starts at (0,0).\n2. **User's Start Request:** User wants to start at \"South Entrance,\" which isn't a listed waypoint.\n3. **Check for Similar Waypoints:** E5 Entrance is the closest match under South Side but has different coordinates.\n4. **Determine Validity:** Since \"South Entrance\" isn't recognized, the system can't proceed without clarification.\n\n**Response:**\n\nI'm sorry, but \"South Entrance\" doesn't seem to be a valid waypoint in our system. Could you please provide more details or confirm if you meant E5 Entrance?",
