    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote: \"Go North Entrance and then proceed to C&D - Main Entrance.\" I need to parse this command step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into two parts. The first part is to navigate to \"North Entrance,\" and the second part is to go from there to \"C&D - Main Entrance.\"\n\nI remember that each waypoint has specific coordinates. Looking back at the data provided:\n\n- North Entrance isn't directly listed, but South Entrance is at (2243, 1083). Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Oh right, there's \"North Entrance\" as a starting point? No, actually, in the initial waypoints, I don't see a North Entrance entry. Hmm, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, let me double-check the given waypoints:\n\n- South Role: There are several entrances listed like South Entrance at (2243,1083), but no North Entrance. The starting location is (0,0). So if \"North Entrance\" isn't a defined waypoint, that's a problem.\n\nSo when the user says to go to \"North Entrance,\" I need to check if it exists in the list. From the data provided, I don't see a waypoint named \"North Entrance.\" The closest is South Entrance and others, but no North.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the command would be invalid because \"North Entrance\" isn't recognized. According to the rules, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an error message instead of proceeding.\n\nI shouldn't process further actions since the first step is invalid. So the response will inform the user that \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nWait, but sometimes waypoints can be matched with similar names. Let me see if there's any other way to interpret \"North Entrance.\" Maybe it's a typo or perhaps it's a different name. But looking through the list, all entrances are either South or something else.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that \"North Entrance\" isn't available, so I should return an error.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
