For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need freshen up. Take me Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we go can.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"I need to freshen up. Take me Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we go can.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the command step by step. The user starts by wanting to freshen up and specifically mentions going to Shower A first. So my first action should be navigating to Shower A.\n\nNext, after arriving at Shower A, the user wants to go to Shower B. That makes sense as a follow-up, so I'll add a navigate action for Shower B next.\n\nThen, there's a wait command of 1 minute at Shower B. Since wait is one of the supported actions, I can include that after navigating to Shower B.\n\nAfter waiting, the user says \"we go can.\" This part is a bit unclear. \"We go can\" doesn't make much sense grammatically, but considering context, maybe they mean to proceed somewhere else or perhaps just end the sequence. Since there's no specific destination mentioned after, I might assume they're done and don't need further navigation.\n\nI should also check if Shower B is a valid waypoint. From the list provided, I see Shower A listed, but not Shower B. That means when processing the command, after successfully navigating to Shower A, attempting to go to Shower B would trigger an error because it's unknown.\n\nSo the actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A.\n2. Then navigate to Shower B, which doesn't exist.\n3. Upon trying to navigate to Shower B, output a speak action indicating it's invalid.\n\nBut wait, according to the instructions, I should process commands left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So after successfully navigating to Shower A, the next step is to navigate to Shower B, but since it's invalid, I need to handle that error.\n\nTherefore, the actions would be:\n\n- Navigate to Shower A.\n- Then attempt to navigate to Shower B, which doesn't exist, so output an error message about Shower B not being a valid waypoint.\n\nBut looking back at the user's prompt, they mentioned \"Shower A, then Shower B.\" Maybe I should process both steps. However, since Shower B isn't a valid waypoint, after successfully navigating to Shower A, the next command would fail, so I need to handle that in the response.\n\nSo the actions array would include navigate to Shower A, then attempt to navigate to Shower B (which is invalid), leading to an error message about Shower B not existing. However, according to the examples, if any part of the command is invalid, it should return an error and stop processing further actions unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, no. The user's command has multiple steps: go to A, then B, wait at B, then proceed. But since B isn't valid, perhaps only the first navigate action succeeds, and the rest are errors. Alternatively, maybe all subsequent commands after the invalid one should be handled as well.\n\nBut according to the example given where an unknown zone is mentioned, it returns a speak action with the error message, which implies that if any part of the command is invalid, processing stops, and only the error is returned.\n\nSo in this case, since Shower B doesn't exist, after navigating to Shower A, attempting to navigate to B would result in an error. But perhaps I should include all steps up to where the error occurs. However, looking at the example where \"unknown zone\" was part of a longer command, the system only returned the speak action for the invalid waypoint.\n\nTherefore, maybe it's better to process each command step individually and return errors as they come. So in this case, after successfully navigating to Shower A, the next command is to go to Shower B, which is invalid, so I should output an error message about Shower B not existing.\n\nWait, but the user's prompt was a single sentence with multiple actions: \"Take me Shower A, then Shower B.\" So it's a sequence of navigate commands. The system processes each in order.\n\nSo first action: navigate to Shower A (valid). Second action: navigate to Shower B (invalid). Therefore, the response should process the first action successfully and then handle the second as invalid.\n\nBut according to the examples, if any part of the command is ambiguous or unknown, the system returns an error message. So perhaps in this case, since the entire command includes both valid and invalid waypoints, but the user's intent might be to go to Shower A only, and then proceed with the rest, which are invalid.\n\nWait, no. The system processes each part step by step. So first, it navigates to Shower A successfully. Then, it tries to navigate to Shower B, which is unknown, so it outputs an error message for that specific command. Therefore, in the actions array, both the successful navigate and the speak action should be included.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, when a waypoint is unknown, the system returns only the speak action with the error, not including any prior successful actions. For example, in the \"unknown zone\" case, it just returned an error message without acknowledging the prior valid steps.\n\nTherefore, perhaps if any part of the command is invalid, the entire command processing stops, and only the error is output. But I'm not entirely sure. The instruction says to process left-to-right unless stated otherwise, but doesn't specify whether to stop on errors or continue.\n\nGiven that ambiguity, maybe it's safer to include all actions up to the point of failure and then add the error message for the invalid step. So in this case:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A.\n2. Attempt to navigate to Shower B (invalid), so output speak action for that.\n\nHowever, considering that the user might expect all steps to be processed, but only the invalid ones cause errors, it's possible that each step is processed individually. So after successfully navigating to A, the next command (to B) fails, and then perhaps the wait command is skipped because the system stops at the error.\n\nBut I'm not certain about this. Maybe the system processes all steps sequentially, returning an error for any invalid ones but still including the prior successful actions in the response.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each navigate action is a separate step, so if the first is valid and the second isn't, both are included in the actions array with the error message appended after the failed step.\n\nWait, looking at the initial example given by the user: \"Take me Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we go can.\" \n\nThe system would process each part:\n\n- Navigate to Shower A.\n- Then navigate to Shower B (invalid).\n- Then wait for 1 minute (but since Shower B is invalid, this might not be processed).\n\nSo the actions array should include navigating to Shower A, then a speak action indicating Shower B is invalid.\n\nBut how does that look in the JSON structure? The assistant's response needs to return an object with \"role\" and \"message\", where message has \"content\" and possibly \"actions\".\n\nWait no, looking at the initial examples, the output was just text. But in this case, the user's query is about what the system should do, so I'm trying to figure out the correct response.\n\nSo the user provided a thought process, then an answer as per the example, which included only the speak action for the invalid part, but perhaps including all prior steps.\n\nWait, no. In the initial examples, when processing \"unknown zone\", it returned just the error message without acknowledging any prior valid steps. So in this case, since Shower A is valid and B is not, perhaps the system should process both actions: navigate to A, then attempt to navigate to B, which fails, resulting in two actions plus an error.\n\nBut according to the user's example response, they included only the speak action for the invalid part. So maybe the system stops at the first invalid command and returns an error without processing further steps.\n\nTherefore, considering that, after successfully navigating to Shower A, the next step is to navigate to Shower B, which is invalid, so the system would return a speak action indicating that Shower B is invalid.\n\nBut since the user's initial prompt included both steps, perhaps it's better to include all steps in the actions array, even if some fail. So:\n\n- Action 1: Navigate to Shower A (valid).\n- Action 2: Navigate to Shower B (invalid), resulting in a speak action with error message.\n\nThus, the response would have two actions: one navigate and one speak.\n\nBut looking back at the initial examples, when an invalid waypoint is encountered, it only returns the speak action without including prior valid steps. So perhaps the system processes each command step individually and returns an error if any part is invalid.\n\nWait, no. The user's prompt was a single sentence with multiple commands: \"Take me Shower A, then Shower B.\" So maybe the entire command is considered as one request, but in reality, it's a sequence of navigate actions.\n\nI think I need to model this as processing each 'navigate' action in order, and for any that fail (due to invalid waypoint), output an error message. Therefore, the response would include:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A.\n2. Attempt to navigate to Shower B: since it's invalid, output a speak action with the error.\n\nBut how is this structured? The assistant's response should be in JSON format with \"role\" and \"message\". The message can have \"content\" as text, and possibly \"actions\".\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial example:\n\nThe user's query was about what to do for a given prompt, and the response was a detailed thought process ending with the answer. So perhaps in this case, the assistant is supposed to provide a similar structure, but since it's a thinking process, maybe the output isn't JSON.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the initial example had the user's query about what the system should do for a specific prompt, and the response was the system's answer in text. So perhaps this is more of a natural language response rather than a structured JSON object.\n\nTherefore, in my case, I need to write out the thought process as if I'm explaining it to someone, then provide the final answer in the form that would be appropriate for the system to generate, which might be just the speak action indicating the invalid part.\n\nSo, considering all this, perhaps the correct response is only to indicate that Shower B is invalid. But since Shower A was valid, maybe both actions are included: navigate to Shower A and then a speak action for Shower B being invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system should process each command separately, so if one fails, it doesn't affect the others. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn any case, based on the initial examples, when an invalid waypoint is encountered, only that part results in an error message without acknowledging prior valid steps. Therefore, the response would be a speak action indicating that \"Shower B cannot be reached as it's not defined.\"\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, they included navigating to Shower A and then trying to go to B. So perhaps the correct response includes both actions: moving to A, attempting to move to B (failing), but only outputting an error for B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system processes each command step separately. If so, the first navigate to A is successful, and then the next attempt to B fails, resulting in two messages: one indicating arrival at A, and another indicating failure to reach B.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it's intended to work.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to include both actions: navigating to A, then attempting to navigate to B (invalid) with an error message.\n\nTherefore, in terms of the final answer, since the user asked what would happen when given a prompt with certain commands, the response should describe that process. So the system would first move to Shower A, then attempt to move to Shower B and fail, resulting in an error message.\n</think>\n\nThe system processes each command step-by-step. Upon receiving the instruction to navigate to \"Shower A\" and then \"Shower B\", it first successfully moves to Shower A. The next command to move to Shower B fails as it's not defined, prompting an error message indicating that Shower B cannot be reached. \n\n**Answer:**\nThe system navigates to Shower A successfully but encounters an error when attempting to go to Shower B, resulting in the following response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"system\",\n  \"message\": {\n    \"content\": \"Unable to navigate to Shower B as it is not defined.\",\n    \"actions\": []\n  }\n}\n```",
