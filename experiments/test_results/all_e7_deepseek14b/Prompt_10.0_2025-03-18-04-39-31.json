    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to figure out how to respond to the prompt where they ask for directions from the Microwaves back to the E5 Entrance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the given waypoints and their coordinates. From the data provided, there are several waypoints listed with their names and coordinates. However, looking through them, I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves\" or \"E5 Entrance\". The available waypoints include places like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Donuts & Snacks, etc., but not E5 Entrance specifically.\n\nThe user's starting location is at (0,0), which isn't one of the predefined waypoints. They want to navigate from Microwaves to E5 Entrance. Since neither waypoint exists in the provided list, I should trigger an error response.\n\nI remember that if a waypoint doesn't exist, the system should respond by speaking that it's invalid. So, the correct action is to output a speak action indicating both waypoints are not valid.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON structure follows the guidelines: each action is an object with \"action\" and \"input\". Since there are two invalid waypoints, I'll include one message pointing out both issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Microwaves' and 'E5 Entrance' are not valid waypoints\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
