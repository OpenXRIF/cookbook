    "Prompt": "\"Robot, begin at the North Entrance and proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance to check for any obstructions. Next, visit the Microwaves area and ensure all units are operational.

Finally, head to the South Entrance and report back with your findings.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this user prompt step by step. The user is giving a detailed set of instructions for the robot to follow. They mentioned starting at the North Entrance, then moving through several waypoints: C&D - Main Entrance, Microwaves area, Silent Study, Shower A and B, and finally South Entrance.\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of the command. The robot begins at North Entrance, which is a known waypoint with coordinates (25, 0). So the first action is to navigate there.\n\nNext, from North Entrance, the robot should proceed to C&D - Main Entrance. Looking at the waypoints provided, there's \"C&D - Main Entrance\" at (19, 8). That's straightforward\u2014another navigation action.\n\nThen, the user mentions the Microwaves area. Scanning through the listed waypoints, I don't see any named \"Microwaves\". This is a problem because if the waypoint doesn't exist, the robot can't proceed. According to the guidelines, if a waypoint isn't recognized, it should speak an error message.\n\nHowever, before jumping to conclusions, maybe there's another way to interpret this. Perhaps \"Microwaves\" refers to a nearby area or part of another waypoint. But without exact matches in the provided list, it's safer to assume it's unknown. So, after attempting to navigate to C&D - Main Entrance, upon realizing that Microwaves isn't found, the robot should inform the user.\n\nSimilarly, \"Silent Study\" and \"Shower B\" aren't listed as waypoints. Shower A exists but not Shower B. So each of these would trigger an error message if attempted. \n\nThe final destination is South Entrance, which does exist at (0, 25), so that part can be handled once previous steps are addressed.\n\nI should structure the response to handle each waypoint in sequence. If any step fails due to an unknown waypoint, the robot speaks an error and stops further actions unless instructed otherwise.\n\nSo, the actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate from starting point (0,0) to North Entrance.\n2. From there, navigate to C&D - Main Entrance.\n3. Attempt to go to Microwaves area; if not found, speak the error message.\n\nSince each step depends on the previous one being successful, if any waypoint is unknown, subsequent steps can't be executed. Therefore, after failing at Microwaves, the robot stops and speaks the error, preventing further actions that might be based on incorrect data.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"North Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Microwaves' is not a valid waypoint\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
