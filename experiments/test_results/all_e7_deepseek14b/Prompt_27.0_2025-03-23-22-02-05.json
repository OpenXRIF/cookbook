For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the Elevators. Wait their for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this prompt: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Entrance.\" Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is asking to be taken to the Elevators. From the list of waypoints, I see an entry called \"Elevators\" with coordinates (30,25). So that should be straightforward\u2014navigate there.\n\nNext, after arriving at the elevators, the user wants to wait for 15 seconds. That's a simple wait action with input 15.\n\nThen, after waiting, they want to find the East Entrance. Wait, looking at the waypoints provided, I don't see an \"East Enterance\" listed. There is an \"East Entrance\" maybe? Let me check again: nope, it says \"East Enterance.\" Oh, wait, in the list, there's \"East Enterance\"\u2014I think that's a typo, and they meant \"Entrance,\" but perhaps in their system, it's actually \"East Enterance.\" Wait, no, looking back at the waypoints given\u2014no, I don't see an East Entrance listed. The available ones are: Starting Locations, Elevators, RoboHub, etc., but not East Enterance.\n\nWait a minute, maybe they meant \"East Entrance\" as in a common area? Or perhaps it's another waypoint that wasn't listed here. Hmm, since in the provided data, there isn't an East Enterance or East Entrance, I might have to check if it's a typo for \"East Enterance.\" But in the given waypoints, there's no such name.\n\nSo, when the user says \"find the East Enterance,\" the system needs to process this. Using advanced fuzzy matching as per the instructions: normalize both inputs to lowercase, remove extraneous tokens like building codes, tokenize, and then check for similarity.\n\nThe user's input is \"east enterance.\" The known waypoints include \"East Entrance\" but wait\u2014no, actually in the provided data, I don't see that. Wait, looking back at the list:\n\nWaypoints listed:\n- Starting Locations\n- Elevators\n- RoboHub\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - Coffee Area\nWait, no, looking again: The waypoints include \"East Enterance\" with X and Y coordinates? Let me check.\n\nWait no, in the user's provided data, there are multiple waypoints under C&D areas, but I don't see an East Entrance or East Enterance. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me look:\n\nLooking at the list: The last waypoint is \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So, no East Enterance listed.\n\nTherefore, when the user says to go to the East Enterance after waiting, the system will recognize that this waypoint doesn't exist because it's not in the provided list. Thus, it should return an error message for that part of the command.\n\nBut wait, the prompt is a single instruction: \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait their for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\"\n\nSo, the first two actions are valid: navigating to elevators and waiting. The third action is invalid because East Enterance isn't a known waypoint.\n\nTherefore, according to the instructions, if any part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, return a single speak action with an error message. So in this case, after successfully navigating to Elevators and waiting, attempting to navigate to East Enterance would fail, but since it's part of the same command, perhaps the entire command should be considered as having an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe process each step: first, go to elevators (valid), then wait (valid), then try to find East Enterance (invalid). Since the last part is invalid, the whole command would result in an error message.\n\nBut according to the handling of complex commands, it's processed left-to-right. So the system should execute each action until it hits an invalid one, but since the user wants to go through all steps, if any step fails, the entire command might be considered invalid.\n\nWait, no: the instructions say that for commands with multiple steps, output them in order unless explicitly stated otherwise. If a waypoint is unknown, return the speak action for that specific part. But in this case, the first two actions are valid; only the last one is invalid.\n\nSo perhaps the system should process the first two actions and then upon attempting the third, realize it's invalid and output an error message. However, since the user provided a single prompt, maybe all actions need to be considered together.\n\nWait, looking at the supported edge cases: if a waypoint is unknown, return a speak action saying so. So in this case, when trying to navigate to East Enterance, which doesn't exist, it should output that message.\n\nBut since the user's command has multiple steps, perhaps only the last step fails. Therefore, the response would be:\n\n1. Navigate to Elevators.\n2. Wait for 15 seconds.\n3. Attempt to find East Enterance (invalid), so return error message.\n\nHowever, according to the instructions, if any part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, return a single speak action with an error message. So perhaps the entire prompt should be considered as having an error because the last step is invalid, leading to just returning the error message without executing any actions.\n\nAlternatively, process each step: first two are valid; the third is invalid. But I think in this case, since the user wants all steps executed sequentially, if any step fails, the whole command may be aborted, but perhaps the system should still execute the possible steps and then inform about the error.\n\nBut according to the examples given, when a waypoint is unknown, it returns an error message regardless of other valid actions. So perhaps in this case, since East Enterance doesn't exist, the entire prompt results in an error message.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example response provided by the user: when they asked about \"East Enterance,\" the system responded with navigating to Elevators and waiting, then trying to find East Enterance but couldn't. So perhaps in this case, it's acceptable to process the first two valid steps and then inform about the invalid third step.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if any part is unknown, return an error message. Hmm, maybe I should just follow the example given, which shows that even though one part was invalid, the system still processed the other parts.\n\nIn the user's example response, they had:\n\n1. Navigate to Elevators.\n2. Wait 15 seconds.\n3. Attempt to find East Enterance (invalid), so return error message.\n\nBut in their response, they only returned the two valid actions and then an error for the last one. So perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the system would:\n\n- Navigate to Elevators at (30,25).\n- Wait for 15 seconds.\n- Attempt to navigate to East Enterance but since it doesn't exist, return a speak action saying so.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if any part is invalid, return an error. So perhaps after executing the first two actions, upon attempting the third, which is invalid, the system would stop and inform the user.\n\nAlternatively, the entire command might be considered as having failed because one part is invalid, leading to not executing any steps beyond that point.\n\nBut I think in this case, since the first two steps are valid, they should be executed, and then upon attempting the third step, which is invalid, an error message should be returned without further actions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the system would:\n\n1. Navigate to Elevators.\n2. Wait for 15 seconds.\n3. Attempt to navigate to East Enterance\u2014since it doesn't exist, return an error message.\n\nThus, in the response, the first two actions are included as they're valid, and then the third part is invalid, prompting an error message.\n\nWait, but according to the initial prompt, the user said \"Take me to the Elevators. Wait there for 15 seconds, and then let's find the East Enterance.\" So perhaps all three actions need to be processed in sequence. If any step fails, the whole command might fail. But since the first two are valid, I think they should be executed, and upon realizing the third is invalid, inform the user.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system processes each action sequentially, so after waiting, it tries to find East Enterance, which doesn't exist, leading to an error message.\n\nTherefore, the response would include navigating to Elevators, waiting, then informing about the non-existent East Enterance.\n</think>\n\nThe system processes the command in sequence:\n\n1. **Navigate to Elevators**: The system moves to the Elevators at coordinates (30,25).\n2. **Wait for 15 seconds**: The system waits there as instructed.\n3. **Attempt to find East Enterance**: Since East Enterance is not a recognized waypoint, the system informs the user with an error message.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": [\n    {\n      \"command\": \"navigate\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"x\": 30,\n        \"y\": 25\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"command\": \"wait\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"time\": 15\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"command\": \"speak\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"text\": \"I'm sorry, but I cannot find the East Enterance.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
