    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there are any waypoints that match \"E7 silent study.\" Looking at the list provided, I see waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Ideas Clinic,\" etc., but nothing related to \"E7\" or \"silent study.\"\n\nI remember from the normalization and tokenization steps that I should convert both the user's input and waypoint names to lowercase. So, the user's input becomes \"e7 silent study.\" Now, let me compare each waypoint name against this.\n\nThe waypoints have names like \"c&d - coffee area,\" which doesn't match at all. There's also \"E7\" mentioned in some of them, but not combined with \"silent study.\" For example, \"C&D - Coffee Area\" has tokens related to coffee and area, but nothing close to the user's request.\n\nNext, I consider extraneous token removal. The user didn't include any building codes like \"C&D,\" so that step doesn't affect this case. Tokenization splits the input into [\"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\"], and none of these tokens are present in any waypoint names.\n\nThe similarity calculation would check if all tokens from the waypoint name appear in the user's input, which they don't. Also, even a high percentage match isn't met since none of the waypoints have those specific tokens.\n\nSince no known waypoints meet the threshold, I need to output an action where the system speaks and says that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
