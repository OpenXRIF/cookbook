    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's figure out how to handle the user's prompt. The user said, \"I could really go for a shower.\" I need to determine what action to take based on this.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there are any waypoints related to showers. Looking at the list provided, the waypoints include things like C&D Coffee Area and RoboHub Entrance, but nothing about showers or restrooms. So, it seems like \"shower\" isn't a recognized waypoint here.\n\nNext, I should consider if there's another way to interpret this request. Maybe the user is trying to go to a specific location that offers showers, but from the given data, there's no such waypoint listed. The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. Since showering isn't an action that fits into these categories directly, it's likely the user wants to move to a place with a shower.\n\nSince \"shower\" doesn't match any existing waypoints, I should respond by informing them that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the guidelines, if the waypoint is unknown, I need to output a speak action with an appropriate message.\n\nI think the best response here is to tell the user that their requested location isn't recognized and offer assistance in navigating elsewhere if they have another destination in mind.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist.
