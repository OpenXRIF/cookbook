For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Go to the North Entrance and then proceed to the C&D - Main Entrance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what they're asking for. They want me to navigate to two places in order: first the North Entrance, then the C&D - Main Entrance.\n\nI should check if both waypoints exist based on the data provided. Looking at the list, there's a waypoint called \"E5 Entrance,\" but nothing named \"North Entrance\" or \"C&D - Main Entrance.\" Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, there's an E5 Entrance with coordinates (1535, 1535), and under South Side. There's also a C&D area with various sections like Coffee Area, but not a Main Entrance listed. The North Entrance isn't present either.\n\nSo the first waypoint, North Entrance, doesn't exist. When processing this, according to the rules, if any part of the command is invalid or unknown, I should return an error message.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"North Entrance\" could be a waypoint that's not listed. Or perhaps it's a typo. However, based on the given data, North Entrance isn't present. Similarly, C&D - Main Entrance isn't either; only specific areas under C&D are listed.\n\nTherefore, since both waypoints aren't recognized, I should trigger an error response. The example shows that if any waypoint is unknown, it returns a speak action saying the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, my response will be to speak and inform the user that \"North Entrance\" doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
