    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt: \"Move to the RoboHub and then proceed to the Silent Study's.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check if all the waypoints mentioned are valid. The user is asking to move to \"RoboHub\" first. Looking back at the provided waypoints, I don't see any entry for \"RoboHub\". Hmm, that might be a problem because without knowing its coordinates, I can't navigate there.\n\nNext, after reaching RoboHub, the user wants to proceed to \"Silent Study's.\" Again, checking the list of waypoints, I don't see \"Silent Study's\" either. This means both locations are unknown to me.\n\nSince both waypoints aren't recognized, according to the guidelines, I should return an error message indicating that one of the waypoints doesn't exist. Even though there might be other issues like navigating between them or waiting times, the primary issue here is invalid waypoints.\n\nI need to make sure my response follows the structure specified. The actions array should have a single speak action with the appropriate error message pointing out the invalid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'RoboHub' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
