    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this prompt where the user is asking me to \"go to the Dairy Queen.\" First, I need to figure out if there's a matching waypoint for that. Let's see... The list of waypoints provided includes places like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Coffee Area again, and others, but there's no mention of Dairy Queen or anything related.\n\nI should follow the steps given in the normalization process. I'll convert both the user input and each waypoint name to lowercase. So \"Dairy Queen\" becomes \"dairy queen.\" Then, remove any extraneous tokens that are building codes or non-essential. In this case, there don't seem to be any such tokens.\n\nNext, I'll tokenize both the input and the waypoints. The user's input is just two words: [\"dairy\", \"queen\"]. Now, looking at each waypoint name, none of them match these tokens in sequence or as part of their names. For example, \"c&d - coffee area\" doesn't have either \"dairy\" or \"queen.\" \n\nMoving on to similarity calculation, I need to check if every token from the waypoint name is present in the user's input or if a high percentage (like 80%) of tokens are there. Since none of the waypoints have any overlapping tokens with the user's query, the similarity score would be zero for all.\n\nSince no waypoints meet the threshold, I'll need to respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. According to the instructions, in such cases, I should output a speak action indicating that. So the response will inform the user that \"Dairy Queen\" isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
