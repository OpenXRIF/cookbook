For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"I need to freshen up. Take me to Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to freshen up and be taken to Shower A, then Shower B, with a wait of 1 minute at Shower B before they can proceed. First, I need to parse this command carefully.\n\nStarting off, the user mentioned \"Take me to Shower A, then Shower B.\" So, my first thought is that there are two showers here: A and B. But looking back at the waypoint list provided, I only see a single \"Shower A\" listed. There's no mention of Shower B. That might be an issue because if Shower B doesn't exist, it could cause problems in navigation.\n\nI need to check all the waypoints again to make sure I didn't miss any. Scrolling through the list... Nope, only Shower A is present. So, when the user asks for Shower B, that's a waypoint we don't have.\n\nAccording to the instructions, if a waypoint doesn't exist, we should output an action where the AI speaks and says it doesn't exist. Also, since the command includes multiple steps, I need to process them in order. But because Shower B isn't valid, the entire sequence can't be completed as intended.\n\nSo, the appropriate response would be to inform the user that Shower B isn't a valid waypoint when trying to navigate there after Shower A. Alternatively, maybe after successfully navigating to Shower A, attempt to go to Shower B and then realize it's invalid. But in this case, I think it's better to handle it upfront before executing any navigation that might lead to an error.\n\nWait, no, the instructions say to process commands left-to-right. So first, navigate to Shower A, then from there try to go to Shower B. Since Shower B isn't valid, at that point, we should return the error message about the waypoint not existing.\n\nBut looking back, in the examples provided, if a waypoint is unknown, it returns a speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\" So, after navigating to Shower A, the next step would be to navigate to Shower B. Since that's invalid, the system should respond with the error message and stop processing further actions.\n\nTherefore, the actions should first include navigating to Shower A, then attempting to navigate to Shower B, which fails, resulting in a speak action indicating the problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the user provided two showers, maybe I should check if both are valid before executing any. But according to the instructions, we process each command step by step, so it's better to proceed as per sequence and handle errors when they occur.\n\nSo, the actions would be: first navigate to Shower A (valid), then attempt to go to Shower B (invalid). Upon detecting the invalid waypoint, output the speak action with the error message. The wait command after that might not be necessary since the process stops at the error.\n\nWait, but in the example given where an unknown zone is requested, the response was a single speak action. So, perhaps if any part of the command leads to an invalid waypoint, the entire sequence should stop and return the error message without executing further actions.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to navigate to Shower A first. Once there, attempt to go to Shower B. Since Shower B isn't a valid waypoint, trigger the speak action with the appropriate message. The wait command after that might not be executed because the process has already halted at the error.\n\nSo, in the JSON response, I should include two actions: navigate to Shower A, then navigate to Shower B (which would fail), but according to the instructions, if a waypoint is unknown during processing, it outputs the speak action. Therefore, perhaps only one action is needed\u2014the speak message\u2014since the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait no, because the user's command includes two navigation steps and a wait. The first step is valid (Shower A), so that should be executed. Then, the second step (Shower B) is invalid, so we need to output an error at that point.\n\nSo, in the response, I would have:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A.\n2. Attempt to navigate to Shower B but fail, resulting in a speak action.\n\nBut according to the instructions, when processing complex commands, if any step fails (like an invalid waypoint), we return the error message and stop further actions. So perhaps only one action is needed: speaking about the invalid waypoint, without executing the first navigation.\n\nWait, no. The examples show that for invalid or ambiguous commands, a single speak action with an error message is returned. But in this case, part of the command is valid (Shower A) and part is invalid (Shower B). So, perhaps we should process as much as possible until the first error.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire command includes multiple steps, and one of them is invalid, it's better to return an error without executing any actions. But in the example where the user asked for C&D areas and RoboHub, the system navigated successfully because both were valid.\n\nIn this case, only Shower B is invalid. So, perhaps first navigate to Shower A (valid), then attempt to go to Shower B (invalid), leading to an error message. Therefore, in the response, I would include two actions: navigating to Shower A and then speaking about Shower B not existing.\n\nBut according to the instructions, if during processing a command a waypoint is invalid, we should return an action where we speak that it doesn't exist. So perhaps only the second part fails, but since the user might have intended both steps, maybe we need to check all waypoints first before executing any.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify: according to the instructions, when processing complex commands with multiple steps, each step is executed in order. If at any point an invalid waypoint is encountered, that's where the error occurs, and further actions are not processed.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- First action: Navigate to Shower A (valid).\n- Second action: Navigate to Shower B (invalid).\n\nUpon attempting the second action, since Shower B isn't a valid waypoint, we output the speak action with \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON response should include both actions up until the point of failure. So, the first navigate action is executed, and then the error occurs on the second navigate, leading to the speak message.\n\nBut looking at the example where the user requested an unknown zone, the response was just a single speak action without any preceding navigation. However, in this case, part of the command is valid (Shower A), so perhaps we should process that first and then handle the error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to validate all waypoints before executing any actions, but I don't think that's specified in the instructions. The instructions say to process each step sequentially.\n\nSo, putting this together, the response would be:\n\n1. Navigate to Shower A.\n2. Attempt to navigate to Shower B, which fails, leading to a speak action about the invalid waypoint.\n\nBut according to the system's behavior in examples, when an invalid waypoint is encountered during processing, it outputs just the speak message without necessarily showing the previous successful action. So perhaps only the second action (navigate to Shower B) is where the error occurs, and thus the response includes that speak message.\n\nWait, no, because the user's command was a single instruction with multiple steps. The system processes each step in order. If any step fails, it outputs an error and stops further processing. Therefore, after successfully navigating to Shower A, it would attempt the next step (Shower B), find it invalid, and then output the speak message.\n\nBut since the instructions say that if a waypoint is invalid during processing, return the error message without completing the command, perhaps only the second action is needed in the response. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system doesn't execute any actions until all waypoints are validated. So, if Shower B isn't valid, it returns an error before executing any navigation. That would make sense too, as trying to navigate somewhere invalid after a valid step might complicate things.\n\nBut without explicit instructions on whether to validate all steps upfront or process each sequentially, I think the safest approach is to proceed step by step and handle errors when they occur.\n\nTherefore, in the response, I would include:\n\n1. A navigate action to Shower A.\n2. Then attempt to navigate to Shower B, which fails, leading to a speak message about the invalid waypoint.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example provided where an unknown zone was requested, the response was just a single speak action without any preceding actions. So perhaps in cases where any part of the command is invalid, regardless of prior valid steps, the system should return the error immediately without executing any actions.\n\nIn that case, since Shower B isn't valid, even though Shower A is, the entire command would be rejected, and only the speak message would be returned.\n\nI think this makes sense because if part of the command can't be executed (like navigating to an invalid location), it's better to inform the user upfront rather than partially executing commands that might lead to confusion or errors.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON response should contain a single action: a speak message indicating that Shower B doesn't exist. The navigate actions wouldn't be included because the command as a whole is invalid due to the second step.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"speak\": \"This waypoint does not exist.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
