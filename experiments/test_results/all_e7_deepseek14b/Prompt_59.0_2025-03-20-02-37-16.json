For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"\n",

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the E7 silent study.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this prompt where the user is asking to be taken to \"E7 silent study.\" Let's break down how I would approach solving this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They're requesting a navigation action to a specific location: \"E7 silent study.\" My goal is to determine if this location exists based on the provided waypoints and then generate the appropriate response.\n\nLooking at the list of waypoints provided, I see that there's an E5 Entrance mentioned, which includes coordinates and some associated information. However, there's no waypoint listed for E7 or any mention of a \"silent study\" area. This makes me think that \"E7 silent study\" isn't one of the predefined locations.\n\nNext, I should consider how to handle this unknown location. According to the instructions, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I need to return an action where the agent speaks and states that the waypoint doesn't exist. The example given for an unknown waypoint is exactly this scenario, so I can model my response after that.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm following the normalization and token removal steps correctly. The user's input would be converted to lowercase, which in this case becomes \"e7 silent study.\" Then, any extraneous tokens like building codes (which are letters followed by numbers) at the beginning should be removed. However, since \"silent study\" doesn't match any existing waypoint names, even after processing, it still won't find a match.\n\nAdditionally, I have to ensure that I'm not using any unsupported actions beyond navigate, speak, or wait. Since the response here is just a speak action, there's no issue with unsupported functions.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct response is to inform the user that \"E7 silent study\" isn't a valid waypoint by speaking the appropriate message.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **User Input Analysis:** The user requests navigation to \"E7 silent study.\"\n2. **Normalization and Token Removal:** Convert input to lowercase, resulting in \"e7 silent study.\" Remove any extraneous building codes if present; however, no such code is identified here.\n3. **Waypoint Matching:** Compare the processed input against all known waypoints. No matching waypoint exists for \"E7 silent study.\"\n4. **Handling Unknown Waypoint:** Since the waypoint doesn't exist, return a speak action indicating this.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
