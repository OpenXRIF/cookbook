    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user said, \"Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into parts. The main actions here are navigating to a specific waypoint and then waiting for a certain amount of time. \n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there's one named \"C&D - Main Entrance\" with coordinates (25, 75). That seems like the correct destination. \n\nNext, I need to handle the wait command. The user specified 10 minutes, but in the examples, waiting is done using the function with an integer input, which I assume is seconds. However, since the example used \"wait\" for 10 seconds when meeting Zach, maybe it's safe to use 600 seconds (which is 10 minutes) here.\n\nI should structure the response as a list of actions. The first action will be navigating to C&D - Main Entrance, and the second will be waiting for 600 seconds.\n\nI need to make sure that each action is correctly formatted with \"action\" and \"input\". For navigation, I include the name and coordinates. For waiting, just the time in seconds as an integer.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should have two actions: navigate and wait.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Main Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 600\n        }\n    ]\n}",
