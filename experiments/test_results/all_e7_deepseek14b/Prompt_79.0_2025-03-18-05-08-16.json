    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the prompt: \"go to the vending machines and get me a lays bbq chips\". Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the user is giving me a command to navigate to a location and perform an action. The starting point is (0,0), but I don't think that affects anything here because the command is about going to the vending machines.\n\nThe prompt has two main parts: \"go to the vending machines\" and \"get me a lays bbq chips\". So, I need to see if there's a waypoint named something like \"vending machines\" or similar.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, let me check each one. There are several C&D area waypoints: Coffee Area, maybe others. Wait, no, the list includes C&D - Coffee Area, but not vending machines. Oh, wait! Maybe I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the available waypoints don't include \"vending machines\". The user is asking about going to the vending machines and getting specific chips. Since there's no such waypoint in the provided data, this might be an unknown location.\n\nSo, if the system can't find a matching waypoint for \"vending machines\", it should respond by speaking that the waypoint doesn't exist. It shouldn't try to navigate anywhere because it can't find the destination.\n\nTherefore, the action would be a speak command informing the user that the vending machines aren't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
