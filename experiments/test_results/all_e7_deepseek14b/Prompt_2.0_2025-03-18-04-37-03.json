    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should parse the command. It looks like there are two navigation steps: first to the Ideas Clinic and then to the Assembly Room. So the actions will involve navigating to each location in order.\n\nBut wait, looking at the provided waypoints, I don't see \"Ideas Clinic\" or \"Assembly Room.\" The available waypoints are things like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - Ideas Clinic,\" etc., but not exactly those names. Hmm, maybe there's a typo or something missing.\n\nI need to check if \"Ideas Clinic\" is listed. Oh, actually, in the waypoint list provided earlier, I see \"C&D - Ideas Clinic.\" So maybe the user meant that, even though they referred to it as \"Ideas Clinic\" without the C&D prefix.\n\nAlso, \"Assembly Room\" isn't listed at all. So for each part of the command, I need to find a matching waypoint or determine if it's invalid.\n\nFirst part: Navigate to the Ideas Clinic. The closest match is \"C&D - Ideas Clinic.\" So that should be the target.\n\nSecond part: Go to the Assembly Room. Since there's no such waypoint, this will trigger an error message saying it doesn't exist.\n\nSo my response should involve navigating to the Ideas Clinic first and then handling the invalid command for the Assembly Room.\n</think>\n\nThe user is trying to navigate to two locations: the Ideas Clinic and the Assembly Room. However, the Assembly Room isn't a valid waypoint. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. The user's command includes two navigation steps.\n2. First, navigate to \"Ideas Clinic,\" which matches \"C&D - Ideas Clinic.\"\n3. Second, navigate to \"Assembly Room,\" which doesn't exist.\n4. Since the second part is invalid, return an error message.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 200\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
