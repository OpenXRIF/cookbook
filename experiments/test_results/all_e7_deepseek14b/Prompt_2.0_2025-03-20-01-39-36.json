For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt ID": 2.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\" Okay, so first, I need to parse this command and break it down into actions that my system can understand.\n\nI remember from the instructions that the starting location is (0,0), but in this case, the user isn't specifying a start point, just giving two destinations. So, my task is to create a sequence of navigate actions for each destination.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided, there's an \"Ideas Clinic\" listed with coordinates (1427), and \"Assembly Room\" which I need to check if it's one of the waypoints. Wait, checking the list, I don't see \"Assembly Room\" explicitly mentioned. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The user has an \"E5 Entrance\" but not Assembly Room. So maybe there's no exact match for Assembly Room in the given waypoints. That could mean the user is referring to something else or perhaps it's named differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use fuzzy matching as per the guidelines. Let me think about how that works. The user input would be normalized and compared against each waypoint name after removing extraneous tokens.\n\nSo, \"Ideas Clinic\" is straightforward because there's a waypoint named exactly that. But for \"Assembly Room,\" I need to see if any of the waypoints match closely enough based on token similarity. Looking at the list again, I don't see any waypoints with \"assembly\" or similar terms. Maybe it's in another part of the building not listed here.\n\nIf there's no exact or sufficiently similar waypoint, then my system should respond that it doesn't exist and speak an error message. However, since the prompt has two parts, I have to handle both actions sequentially. So if one is valid and the other isn't, perhaps I can proceed with the valid one and then inform about the invalid.\n\nWait, but in this case, \"Ideas Clinic\" does exist, so my first action would be navigate there. Then, after that, attempt to go to Assembly Room. But since it doesn't exist, maybe the second part should trigger an error message.\n\nBut according to the instructions, each command is processed left-to-right, and if any step fails, perhaps I need to handle it appropriately. Alternatively, if multiple waypoints meet the similarity threshold, select the one with the highest score.\n\nWait, for \"Assembly Room,\" let me try the fuzzy matching steps again. Normalize both inputs: user input becomes lowercase. Remove any extraneous tokens\u2014like building codes or numbers at the start. Then tokenize both.\n\nLooking at \"assembly room\" vs the waypoints: none match exactly. So no waypoint would have all tokens present, and perhaps even a high percentage match isn't achieved because none of the waypoints include 'assembly' or 'room'.\n\nTherefore, when trying to navigate to Assembly Room, my system should recognize it as an unknown waypoint and respond accordingly.\n\nBut in the given example prompt, if one part is known and the other isn't, how do I handle that? The user's instruction was to go to both locations. So maybe I need to first navigate to Ideas Clinic, then attempt to navigate to Assembly Room, which would result in an error message for the second step.\n\nBut according to the structure of the response examples, if any part is invalid, it might return a speak action with an error message. However, since the user provided two separate commands linked by \"and then,\" I think each should be processed as separate actions but in sequence.\n\nSo, the first action would be navigating to Ideas Clinic, which exists. The second would attempt to navigate to Assembly Room, which doesn't exist, so it would trigger a speak action saying that waypoint isn't valid.\n\nBut wait, in the response examples, when part of the command is invalid or ambiguous, they return an error. So perhaps in this case, since both steps are attempted but one fails, the entire command might be considered invalid? Or maybe process the first successfully and then inform about the second?\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to process each step individually. The first navigate action is valid, so proceed with that, and then upon trying to navigate to Assembly Room, which isn't found, respond accordingly.\n\nBut according to the example where a waypoint doesn't exist in the middle of commands, perhaps the system should stop processing further actions after the error occurs. So, in this case, I would first process navigating to Ideas Clinic, then attempt the next step and fail, resulting in an error message.\n\nHowever, looking back at the instruction, for complex commands with multiple steps, each is processed left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So if the second step fails, it should output the speak action for that failure after the successful first action.\n\nWait, but in this specific case, the user wrote \"navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room.\" If the system can process both actions as separate steps, then perhaps the response would include two navigate actions followed by an error message if needed. But since only the second one is invalid, it might result in a speak action after attempting the first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire command is considered a single instruction, and if any part fails, the whole thing results in an error. But I'm not sure about that from the instructions.\n\nWait, let me look back at the example given: when a user wrote \"navigate to the Ideas Clinic and then go to the Assembly Room,\" the response was two navigate actions with coordinates for each, even though in reality, the second location wasn't specified. So maybe in this case, the system assumes both are valid or proceeds as if they were.\n\nBut since I don't have the exact coordinates for Assembly Room, perhaps it's safer to proceed only with the known waypoint and inform about the unknown one.\n\nWait, no. In the initial example response provided by the user, the system responded with navigate actions for both locations without error. So maybe the second location is valid in that context, but in my case, since it's not listed, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake earlier because when looking at the list of waypoints, \"E5 Entrance\" was mentioned, but not Assembly Room. Therefore, I should respond that the first navigate action is successful, then attempt the second and inform about its failure.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, since the user's instruction includes two steps, both need to be addressed. So my response would include navigating to Ideas Clinic with the correct coordinates (1427) as per the list, and then attempting to go to Assembly Room, which doesn't exist, resulting in a speak action indicating that.\n\nWait, but how does the system handle sequential actions? Does it process each step one after another, or is there a different way?\n\nI think I need to create two navigate actions and then an error message if the second one fails. But according to the example given by the user, when they had two valid waypoints, the response included both navigate actions without any error.\n\nSo in this case, since \"Ideas Clinic\" exists but \"Assembly Room\" doesn't, I should first process navigating to Ideas Clinic and then inform about the failure for Assembly Room. But perhaps it's better to only process the known location and ignore the unknown one or mention that the second part is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to attempt each step in sequence. So first, navigate to Ideas Clinic (1427), then try to go to Assembly Room, which isn't found, leading to a speak action indicating that error.\n\nTherefore, the response would include two actions: navigate to Ideas Clinic with coordinates 1427, and then a speak action saying \"The waypoint 'Assembly Room' does not exist.\" Alternatively, perhaps it's structured as navigating first, then attempting the second and failing, resulting in an error message.\n\nBut looking at how the example was handled, when both steps were valid, they were both included. So maybe here, only the first is valid, so include that navigate action, and then handle the second step with a speak action for the invalid waypoint.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused about whether to include both actions or just process the valid one. Let me think again: the user's command was two separate navigations connected by \"and then.\" So each should be processed as individual steps.\n\nTherefore, the response would have two navigate actions with their respective coordinates if known, and a speak action if unknown. But since only the first is known, perhaps the second step is invalid, leading to an error message after the first navigate action.\n\nWait, but I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the system just processes each command as per its validity. So for \"navigate to Ideas Clinic,\" it's valid with coordinates 1427, so include that. Then, \"go to Assembly Room\" is invalid, so include a speak action about that.\n\nTherefore, the response would have both actions: first navigate, then a speak message. But in the example given by the user, when both were valid, they included two navigates. So perhaps I should do the same here, including the known one and handling the unknown as an error.\n\nBut wait, maybe the correct approach is to only process the first command since the second fails. Or perhaps it's better to include all possible actions and then handle errors for each invalid step.\n\nI think the best way is to proceed with the first navigate action, which is valid, and then attempt the second, which isn't, resulting in an error message. So the response would be two navigate actions and one speak action, but since the second location doesn't exist, it's unclear if I should include both.\n\nWait, perhaps the system only processes each step as they come, so first, navigate to Ideas Clinic, then try the next step. If the second fails, it might result in an error message after that.\n\nTherefore, my final response would be two actions: navigate to 1427 for the clinic and then a speak action indicating that Assembly Room isn't found.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Valid Commands:** The user's command includes two navigational steps: going to \"Ideas Clinic\" and then \"Assembly Room.\" From the provided data, only \"Ideas Clinic\" is a valid waypoint with coordinates 1427.\n\n2. **Process Each Command Individually:** Since each step is separate, process them one after another. \n\n3. **Execute Valid Navigation:** Navigate to \"Ideas Clinic\" at coordinate 1427.\n\n4. **Handle Invalid Command:** When attempting the second navigation to \"Assembly Room,\" since it's not listed, issue an error message indicating its absence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- Navigate to Ideas Clinic (coordinate 1427).\n- Speak: \"The waypoint 'Assembly Room' does not exist.\"",
