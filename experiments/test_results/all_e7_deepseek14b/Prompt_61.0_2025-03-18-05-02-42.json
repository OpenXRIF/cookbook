    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" First, I need to determine if this is a valid waypoint based on the provided data.\n\nLooking at the waypoints listed earlier, I see names like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"E Role Zone,\" and others. But there's no mention of an \"E7 silent study\" waypoint. The user might be referring to a specific area or room that's not listed in the given data.\n\nI should apply the advanced fuzzy matching steps as outlined. First, I'll normalize both the input and the known waypoints by converting them to lowercase. Then, I'll remove any extraneous tokens, like building codes at the beginning of the input if they exist.\n\nNext, I'll tokenize both the cleaned user input and each waypoint name. The user's input becomes [\"e7\", \"silent\", \"study\"], while the existing waypoints are checked against this. For example, \"E Role Zone\" would be tokenized into [\"e\", \"role\", \"zone\"].\n\nI'll calculate similarity by checking if all tokens from the waypoint appear in the user's input or if a high percentage of tokens match. Since none of the known waypoints have tokens that exactly match \"e7,\" \"silent,\" or \"study,\" it seems like there's no matching waypoint.\n\nTherefore, since the waypoint doesn't exist, I need to return an action where the agent speaks and informs the user that the waypoint is unknown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
