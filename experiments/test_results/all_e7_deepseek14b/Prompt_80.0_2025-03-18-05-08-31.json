    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this prompt where someone says \"Navigate to the first floor staircase.\" First off, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. The user is probably looking to move from their current location to a specific place\u2014the first floor staircase.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there's a Shower B located at X-Coordinate 827 and Y-Coordinate 610 on the East Side. I wonder if that's related to any staircase. Maybe not directly, but perhaps the user is referring to a different location that isn't listed here.\n\nWait, in the list of waypoints, there are places like C&D - Coffee Area, Ideas Clinic, etc., but nothing about staircases. So, when the user mentions \"first floor staircase,\" I don't see an exact match in the waypoint names. The normalization and tokenization steps would convert \"First Floor Staircase\" to lowercase and split into tokens: [\"first\", \"floor\", \"staircase\"]. Looking at each waypoint's name after processing, none of them include all these tokens.\n\nSo, applying the fuzzy matching steps: first, normalize both the input and waypoints. Then remove any extraneous tokens\u2014like building codes or numbers that don't make sense here. Next, tokenize everything. Now, checking if every token from the user's input is present in a waypoint name. Since none of the waypoints have \"first\", \"floor\", or \"staircase\" together, it doesn't match.\n\nAnother approach is to see if 80% or more of the tokens are present. Let's say the user's input has three tokens: \"first\", \"floor\", \"staircase.\" None of the waypoints share any of these, so that won't work either. Therefore, no waypoint matches the criteria.\n\nSince there's no match, according to the instructions, I should return a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. So, the response would be one speak action with the message about the waypoint not existing.\n</think>\n\nThe user is requesting navigation to \"the first floor staircase,\" which isn't listed among the available waypoints. After processing and checking against the provided waypoints, no match was found.\n\n**Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
