    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Robot, navigate to [[C&D - Hot Food Area]], announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly, and wait until further instructions.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the command. The user is giving a series of actions for the robot to perform. They want the robot to navigate to a specific waypoint, announce it, and then wait.\n\nI'll start by checking if \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" is a valid waypoint. Looking through the list provided earlier, I see waypoints like C&D - Coffee Area, but not specifically a Hot Food Area mentioned. However, there's a \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" in the user's command, which isn't listed here. So, maybe it's an error or perhaps it's intended to be inferred.\n\nNext, considering the normalization and tokenization steps, I should convert both the input and waypoint names to lowercase and remove any extraneous tokens like building codes. Then, tokenize them into individual words. \n\nI realize that \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" might not exactly match any existing waypoint. The closest is \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" But since the user specifically mentioned \"Hot Food,\" I need to determine if this counts as a valid waypoint or not. If it's not listed, then according to the rules, the robot should speak that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, when the user asked for RoboHub, and it wasn't explicitly listed, the system still navigated, assuming perhaps it was a known location. But in our case, since \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" isn't in the list, I should treat it as an unknown.\n\nSo, the robot's response would be to speak that this waypoint doesn't exist. It shouldn't attempt navigation because the target is invalid.\n</think>\n\nThe user's command includes navigating to a waypoint that isn't listed, so the robot will inform them of the error.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
