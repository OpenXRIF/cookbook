    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this prompt where the user says, \"I could really go for a shower.\" My job is to figure out what actions to take based on this. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user mentioned they want a shower, which likely means they're looking to navigate to a specific location where showers are available. From the provided waypoints, there's one called \"shower\" at coordinates (951, 616). That seems like the obvious choice.\n\nLooking at the starting location, it's also (951, 616), which is the same as the shower location. So, technically, the user is already there. But I should check if \"shower\" is indeed one of the available waypoints. Scanning through the list, yes, under the Waypoints section, there's a starting location at (951, 616), but that's probably where the shower is located.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking again, the waypoint names provided don't include \"shower.\" The starting location is given as X:951.0 and Y:616.0, which matches the coordinates of the shower, but the name isn't listed among the waypoints. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The initial list provided by the user includes several waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" etc., but I don't see a specific \"shower\" waypoint named. However, the starting location is (951, 616), which might be the shower's coordinates.\n\nSo, perhaps the user is referring to the starting point as the shower area. Alternatively, maybe there's an implied waypoint at those coordinates called \"shower.\" Since the prompt says the starting location is (951,616), and the user wants a shower, I can assume they want to go there.\n\nTherefore, since the user is already at that location, navigating isn't necessary. But according to the examples, if the user is asking to navigate to where they are, perhaps we should just confirm or do nothing. However, in the example given, when the user mentioned \"C and D areas,\" it mapped to a specific waypoint.\n\nIn this case, since the user said \"shower\" but there's no explicit waypoint named that, I might need to consider if \"shower\" is part of any waypoint name or description. Looking back at the waypoints, none are named shower, so perhaps the user meant the starting location, which has those coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system should infer that a shower is available at the starting point, so navigating isn't needed, and maybe just confirm it.\n\nBut since the user mentioned wanting to go for a shower, and given that there's no explicit waypoint named \"shower,\" perhaps I should respond by saying the waypoint doesn't exist. However, considering the starting location's coordinates match what might be the shower's location, maybe I can proceed.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the available waypoints are listed as:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - Coffee Area (another entry)\n- C&D - RoboHub Entrance\n- Ideas Clinic\n- etc., but not a \"shower.\"\n\nSo perhaps the user is referring to the starting location's name. But since there's no name given for that coordinate, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the user might have misspelled or misnamed the waypoint. Using fuzzy matching as per the instructions:\n\n1. Normalize both inputs to lowercase.\n2. Remove extraneous tokens (like building codes).\n3. Tokenize both.\n4. Check if all tokens from the waypoint are in the input, or a high percentage.\n\nBut since there's no \"shower\" waypoint, perhaps the system can't find it and should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but in the starting location, X:951 and Y:616 is where the user is. So if they say they want to go for a shower, maybe they're already there. But without knowing that specific location's name, perhaps I can't navigate there because it's not named.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system should infer that the starting point is where the shower is located and proceed accordingly.\n\nBut looking back at the example given in the problem statement, when the user said \"C and D areas,\" the system matched it to \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" So maybe in this case, \"shower\" needs to be mapped similarly.\n\nWait, but there's no waypoint named \"shower.\" So perhaps the user is mistaken or referring to a location that isn't listed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if the waypoint doesn't exist, we should return an action where the bot speaks saying it doesn't exist.\n\nBut in this case, maybe I can assume that since they're at (951,616), which is their starting point, and perhaps that's the shower. Alternatively, without a named waypoint, it's safer to say it doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but let me check again: the user said \"I could really go for a shower.\" So they might be in a place where a shower is available, like a restroom or locker room, which might not be explicitly named as such. But since none of the waypoints have \"shower\" in their name, I think it's safe to assume that the system doesn't recognize this as a valid waypoint.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response would be for the bot to inform the user that the shower is either already at their current location or that the waypoint isn't recognized. But since the user's statement suggests they want to go somewhere else to shower, and without a named waypoint, I think it's best to respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the bot should navigate to (951, 616) if possible, but since there's no name for that location as \"shower,\" perhaps navigating isn't necessary. Alternatively, maybe the starting point is where the shower is, so they don't need to move.\n\nBut considering the user's intent and the lack of a named waypoint, I think the safest approach is to inform them that the shower isn't recognized.\n</think>\n\nThe bot cannot navigate to a location named \"shower\" as it is not listed among the available waypoints. Therefore, the appropriate response is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"speak\",\n  \"value\": \"I'm sorry, but I can't find a waypoint named 'shower'.\"\n}\n```",
