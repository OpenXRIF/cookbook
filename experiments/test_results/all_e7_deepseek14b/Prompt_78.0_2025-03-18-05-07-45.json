    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user prompt about a robot navigating through various waypoints. The prompt is pretty detailed and gives specific instructions on where to go and what actions to take in sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the user's request carefully. They want the robot to start at the West Entrance, then navigate to Shower A, proceed to Silent Study, pause for 10 seconds, then move to Microwaves, continue to Novelties, travel to Ideas Clinic, and finally end at the South Entrance. Plus, there\u2019s a note about ensuring smooth navigation throughout.\n\nLooking at the provided waypoints, I see that some of these locations are listed, like Shower A on the East Side with coordinates (951, 616). However, others like West Entrance, Silent Study, Microwaves, Novelties, and Ideas Clinic aren't mentioned in the initial data. That's a problem because if those waypoints don't exist, I need to handle that gracefully.\n\nWait, the user included an example where they used \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and \"RoboHub Entrance,\" which matched known waypoints with similar names. So perhaps the robot can use fuzzy matching for these new names as well. Let me think about how that would work.\n\nFor each waypoint mentioned, I need to apply the advanced fuzzy matching steps: normalization, token removal, tokenization, similarity calculation, and then selection based on the highest match. If none of the tokens from the user's input match any known waypoints beyond a certain threshold (like 80%), then it should return an error message.\n\nIn this case, since most of the waypoints are new, I might end up with errors for each missing location except Shower A, which is present. So when processing \"begin at the West Entrance,\" there's no matching waypoint, so it would trigger a speak action saying that waypoint doesn't exist. Similarly, Silent Study and the others wouldn\u2019t match either.\n\nBut wait, in the initial prompt, the robot is supposed to begin at the West Entrance and then go through several other points. If any of these waypoints are invalid, the entire sequence might fail. The user example shows that if one part is invalid, it just speaks an error once, but here multiple waypoints are missing.\n\nHmm, according to the guidelines, each command should be processed left-to-right unless stated otherwise. So if the first waypoint doesn't exist, the robot can\u2019t proceed further and should output the speak action for that error. Then, since no further actions would be taken, it stops there.\n\nBut in the user's example, they had multiple steps but only one invalid waypoint (unknown zone), which resulted in a single speak action. So perhaps the same applies here: if any waypoint is invalid, return an error message once and don't process subsequent commands.\n\nSo, to structure the response, I need to first check each waypoint in order. Starting with West Entrance\u2014since it doesn\u2019t exist\u2014I output a speak action saying so. Then, since no further actions can be taken, that's all.\n</think>\n\nThe robot receives a request to navigate through several waypoints, but upon checking, most of these locations (West Entrance, Silent Study, Microwaves, Novelties, Ideas Clinic) are not recognized. The first waypoint, West Entrance, is invalid.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Parsing the Request:** The user instructs the robot to start at West Entrance and proceed through a series of waypoints.\n2. **Checking Waypoints:** Each waypoint is checked against known locations using fuzzy matching.\n3. **Identifying Invalid Waypoints:** All mentioned waypoints except Shower A are invalid, but since they come after West Entrance, processing stops at the first invalid point.\n4. **Generating Response:** The robot outputs a speak action indicating that West Entrance doesn't exist.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
