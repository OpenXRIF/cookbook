For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The prompt says, \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this command into two separate actions: navigating to E5 Entrance first, and then locating the Microwaves. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nStarting with the normalization part, both the user's input and the waypoint names are converted to lowercase. That means \"E5 Entrance\" becomes \"e5 entrance,\" and \"Microwaves\" becomes \"microwaves.\" \n\nNext, I have to remove any extraneous tokens that might be building codes or non-essential identifiers. For example, if there's a token like \"E5\" at the beginning, it should be discarded because it's likely part of a code, not part of the actual name.\n\nThen, I'll tokenize both the cleaned input and each known waypoint name into individual words. So, \"e5 entrance\" becomes [\"e\", \"5\", \"entrance\"], but since \"e\" is extraneous, we might remove it, leaving us with \"entrance.\" Similarly, for \"microwaves,\" it's just one word.\n\nNow, I need to check if each token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input. For E5 Entrance, after cleaning and removing extraneous tokens, it's just \"entrance.\" The user's input is \"e5 entrance\" which becomes \"entrance\" after processing. So, that should match.\n\nFor \"microwaves,\" I'll look through the list of waypoints to see if any name includes \"microwave\" or similar terms. Looking back at the waypoints provided, there isn't a waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" However, in the initial data, there's an E5 Entrance which has \"Machine Shop\" as part of its description, but that doesn't include microwaves.\n\nI also check other areas like C&D areas, where sometimes microwaves might be located, but according to the given waypoints, they don't have a specific entry for microwaves. So, it's possible that \"microwaves\" isn't recognized as a valid waypoint.\n\nSince the user first asked to navigate to E5 Entrance and then find Microwaves, I'll handle each step. The first action is straightforward: navigating to E5 Entrance. But when trying to process the second part, finding Microwaves, since it's not a valid waypoint, the system should respond with an error message.\n\nSo, in the response, I'll include the navigate action for E5 Entrance and then a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. \n\nI need to structure this into actions. The first action is navigating to E5 Entrance, which exists. The second action is attempting to find Microwaves, but since it's invalid, the system speaks an error message.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should have two actions: navigate to E5 Entrance and then speak that Microwaves isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 1535,\n                \"y\": 1535\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
