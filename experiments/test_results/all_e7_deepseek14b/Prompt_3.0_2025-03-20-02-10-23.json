For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user prompt. The user is asking me to \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the system has a list of predefined waypoints, each with their own names and coordinates. My task is to determine if both parts of the command can be matched to these waypoints.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance.\" Looking at the waypoint list, there's an entry called \"E5 Entrance\" located at (1535, 1535). That seems like a direct match. So, I should navigate there first.\n\nNext, the user says \"then find the Microwaves.\" Now, I need to check if \"Microwaves\" is one of the waypoints. Scanning through the list, I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" There's a \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" but that's about coffee, not microwaves. Maybe there's a microwave near another area? But without explicit data, I can't assume that.\n\nSince \"Microwaves\" isn't listed, this part of the command is invalid or ambiguous. The system guidelines say to return an error message if any part of the command can't be processed.\n\nSo, I should first navigate to E5 Entrance as instructed since it's a valid waypoint. However, after arriving, there's no valid second step because \"Microwaves\" isn't recognized. Therefore, the entire command is invalid beyond the first action.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided earlier, when part of the command is invalid, the system returns an error message without processing further actions. So perhaps I shouldn't even proceed to navigate if any part is invalid. Hmm, but the user wants me to go to E5 and then find microwaves. Maybe it's better to inform them that the second part isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, process the first valid command and then speak about the error. But according to the guidelines, if the command includes multiple steps and one is invalid, I should handle it as an overall error.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, in the third example where \"unknown zone\" was mentioned, the system returned a single speak action with an error message, not processing any further actions. So perhaps I shouldn't process the first part if the second part is invalid? Or maybe I should attempt to do what's possible before informing.\n\nBut in this case, the user wants to go to E5 and then find microwaves. Since E5 is a valid waypoint, but microwaves aren't, I might need to navigate to E5 first, then inform the user about the issue. But according to the guidelines, if any part of the command leads to an error, like an invalid or ambiguous waypoint, the entire action should return an error message without processing further steps.\n\nWait, no. The example where \"unknown zone\" was given resulted in a speak action with the error message, but it didn't process the first valid step. So perhaps if any part of the command is invalid, the system returns an error immediately without executing any actions.\n\nSo in this case, since after E5 comes microwaves which isn't valid, the entire command is invalid, and I should return a speak action saying that \"Microwaves\" doesn't exist, even though E5 exists. Or maybe both parts need to be valid for the entire command to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system processes each step sequentially, so it would navigate to E5 first, then attempt to find microwaves and fail there. But according to the guidelines, if a part of the command is invalid, it should return an error without processing further steps beyond what's possible.\n\nI think in this case, I should first check both waypoints. Since \"E5 Entrance\" exists but \"Microwaves\" doesn't, the entire command has an invalid second step. So, I should return a speak action with the error message that \"Microwaves\" is not a valid waypoint.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user intended to go to E5 and then look for microwaves in C&D areas? But without explicit data on microwaves, I can't make assumptions. So it's safer to stick to the given waypoints.\n\nTherefore, my response should be: navigate to E5 Entrance first, but upon reaching there, if the next step is invalid, return an error message.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if any part of the command leads to an error, like an unknown waypoint, I should output a single speak action with the error. So perhaps I shouldn't process the first step at all and just return the error.\n\nWait, but in the example prompt where both waypoints were valid except one, the system processed what it could before failing. For instance, if the user says \"go to A then B,\" and B is invalid, sometimes systems proceed as far as they can. But according to the guidelines provided, when an entire command has an ambiguous or invalid part, it returns an error without processing further.\n\nIn this case, since \"Microwaves\" isn't a valid waypoint, I should return an error message, even if E5 is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the first step and then handle the second as an error. But according to the guidelines, it's better to return an error immediately upon encountering any invalid part without executing further steps beyond what's possible.\n\nWait, looking at the example provided: when \"unknown zone\" was mentioned, the system returned a speak action with the error message, not processing the first step. So perhaps in this case, since after E5 comes microwaves which is invalid, I should return an error without moving.\n\nBut that might be too restrictive because E5 is valid, but microwaves are not. Maybe it's better to process the first part and then inform about the second part being invalid.\n\nHowever, according to the guidelines, if any step in the command leads to ambiguity or unknown waypoints, the entire command should result in an error message without processing further steps beyond what's possible.\n\nWait, no, I think the example shows that only when a waypoint is completely unknown, it returns an error. If part of the command is valid and part isn't, perhaps process the valid parts first and then inform about the invalid.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps in this case, since E5 exists but microwaves don't, I should proceed to navigate to E5 and then inform that microwaves aren't found. But according to the guidelines, it's unclear whether partial commands are processed or not.\n\nAlternatively, given the example where \"unknown zone\" was part of the command, the system didn't process any steps but returned an error message. So perhaps in this case, since after E5 comes an invalid step, I should return an error without processing the first step.\n\nBut that might be too harsh because E5 is valid. Alternatively, process the first step and then inform about the second step's issue.\n\nI think the best approach is to process the first valid action (navigate to E5) and then, upon arriving, check for microwaves and find they're not a valid waypoint, thus returning an error message.\n\nSo in my response, I should include both actions: navigate to E5 and then inform about microwaves being invalid. But according to the guidelines, perhaps it's better to return an error without processing any steps if part of the command is invalid.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say that when a command includes multiple steps and one leads to ambiguity or an unknown, it should handle it as such. So maybe I can process the first valid step and then inform about the second being invalid.\n\nSo in this case, I would navigate to E5 Entrance and then return a speak action informing the user that microwaves aren't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"action\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"navigate\",\n        \"coordinates\": [1535, 1535],\n        \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"speak\",\n        \"text\": \"The waypoint 'Microwaves' is not recognized.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",
