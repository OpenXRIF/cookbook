    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The prompt is: \"Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.\"\n\nFirst, I should parse this command into its components. The main action here is navigation to a specific location, followed by a spoken statement.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there's no exact match for \"Assembly Room.\" The listed waypoints include places like Shower A, various C&D areas, and others, but not Assembly Room. \n\nI should consider if \"Assembly Room\" could be confused with any existing waypoints through fuzzy matching. But based on the given data, none of the waypoint names are close enough to \"Assembly Room.\"\n\nSince the waypoint doesn't exist, I have to handle this as an unknown command. According to the instructions, in such cases, I should return a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI don't need to consider any other actions because the primary instruction is to navigate to a non-existent location. There's no fallback or alternative since the user specifically mentioned \"Assembly Room,\" which isn't listed.\n\nSo, the appropriate response is to inform the user through speech that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe command includes an attempt to navigate to \"Assembly Room,\" which does not exist in the provided waypoints. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. The user instructs the robot to move to a location named \"Assembly Room.\"\n2. The system checks all available waypoints but finds none matching \"Assembly Room.\"\n3. Since no valid waypoint is found, the system responds by speaking an error message.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
