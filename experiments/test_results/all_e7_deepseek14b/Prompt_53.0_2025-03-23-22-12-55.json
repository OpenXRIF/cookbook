For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Experiment ID": 7.0,
    "Prompt ID": 53.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt where they ask me to travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start with understanding the problem. The user wants to go from their current location (which is at 0,0) to the E5 Entrance, and then from there to find the Microwaves. But looking at the list of waypoints provided, I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" So that's a problem because without knowing where the microwaves are, I can't navigate there.\n\nI remember the instructions mentioned something about handling unknown waypoints. If a waypoint doesn't exist in the list, I should return an action where I speak and say that the waypoint doesn't exist. Also, if there are multiple steps involved, like navigating first to E5 and then trying to find Microwaves, I need to handle each step carefully.\n\nLet me outline the process:\n\n1. **First Step:** Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n   - Check if \"E5 Entrance\" is a valid waypoint. Looking at the list, yes, there's an E5 Entrance with coordinates 1535, 1535. So this part is doable.\n\n2. **Second Step:** From E5 Entrance, navigate to Microwaves.\n   - Check if \"Microwaves\" exists in the waypoints. Scanning through the list, I don't see any waypoint named \"Microwaves.\" The closest related might be areas with food or kitchen equipment, but there's no specific mention of microwaves as a separate waypoint.\n\nSince the second step is invalid because Microwaves isn't recognized, I need to respond appropriately. According to the guidelines, if an unknown waypoint is mentioned, I should output a speak action informing the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nI also have to make sure that I don't proceed with any actions beyond the point where the error occurs. So in this case, I shouldn't navigate to E5 and then try to find Microwaves because the second part is invalid. Instead, I should inform the user as soon as I realize that the Microwaves aren't a valid waypoint.\n\nWait, but does the prompt require me to go to E5 first before realizing the error? Let me think about this. The instructions say that if multiple steps are involved and any step is ambiguous or invalid, I should choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking. But in this case, since the second part of the command is definitely invalid, it's better to handle it upfront without executing any navigation.\n\nSo my response should be: first, check if both waypoints are valid before proceeding. Since the second isn't, I don't proceed with any actions except speaking about the invalid waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should navigate to E5 first and then attempt to find Microwaves, but since Microwaves aren't present, that would result in an error after moving. However, according to the supported edge cases, if a waypoint is unknown, I should output an action with speak indicating it doesn't exist without performing any navigation.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to immediately inform the user about the invalid waypoint \"Microwaves\" and not proceed with navigating anywhere.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided where the user asked to go to the E5 Entrance and then find Microwaves, the answer given was just a speak action saying that Microwaves don't exist. However, the initial thought process considered navigating to E5 first before realizing the error. So perhaps I should only perform actions up until the point where the unknown waypoint is encountered.\n\nHmm, but in the example given, it's possible that the user might have intended for me to navigate to E5 and then look for Microwaves there. However, since Microwaves aren't a valid waypoint, perhaps the system shouldn't proceed beyond that point.\n\nWait, looking back at the example prompt where the user asked to go to an unknown zone and then RoboHub, the response was just a speak action about the invalid waypoint without navigating anywhere else. So in this case, I think it's better not to navigate to E5 if the subsequent step is invalid because there's no point in moving halfway.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the case. Maybe I should attempt each step sequentially and only return an error when the specific unknown waypoint is encountered. Let me check the handling of complex commands: process them left-to-right, so first navigating to E5, then attempting to navigate to Microwaves.\n\nIf after arriving at E5, the system tries to find Microwaves and realizes it doesn't exist, then the correct response would be to speak about that. But perhaps in this case, since the command is \"travel to E5 Entrance and then find the microwaves,\" if both steps are required, but the second is invalid, I should return an error before proceeding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe navigate to E5 first regardless of the next step because the instruction is to perform each action in sequence. Then, upon arriving at E5, attempt the next step.\n\nBut looking back at the guidelines: \"If any part of the command is ambiguous or invalid, you should choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\" So perhaps I need to check all waypoints before proceeding with any actions. But since I can't look ahead in the instructions, I might have to process each step as it comes.\n\nWait, but in reality, the system doesn't know whether the second step is valid until after the first is done. So perhaps the correct approach is to navigate to E5 Entrance and then upon attempting to find Microwaves, realize it's invalid and inform the user at that point.\n\nBut given the example where the user asked for an unknown zone first, the response was just a speak action without moving, so maybe in this case too, I should handle both steps together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system only checks each step as it processes them. So first, navigate to E5, which is valid, then attempt to find Microwaves and realize it's invalid, then respond accordingly.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, when processing complex commands with multiple steps, you process them left-to-right, but if any part is ambiguous or invalid, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process each step sequentially and only perform actions up until the point where an error occurs. So in this case:\n\n1. Attempt to navigate to E5 Entrance.\n   - This is valid, so perform the speak action for navigating there.\n\n2. Then attempt to navigate to Microwaves from E5.\n   - Since Microwaves don't exist, return a speak action about that.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the system is supposed to actually move to E5 before realizing that Microwaves aren't valid. Or perhaps it's better to check all steps for validity before executing any actions.\n\nI think the example given in the guidelines where the user asked for an unknown zone first resulted in just a speak action, implying that no movement was done. So perhaps if any part of the command is invalid, regardless of order, the system should return an error without proceeding further.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since the second step (finding Microwaves) is invalid, I should respond immediately by saying that Microwaves isn't a valid waypoint and not proceed with navigating to E5. But wait, that might be too strict because maybe E5 is valid, but the user made an error in their command.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system processes each step individually. So first, it's told to navigate to E5 Entrance, which is valid, so it does that. Then, from there, it tries to find Microwaves and fails, so it speaks about the invalid waypoint.\n\nBut given the example provided earlier where the user asked for an unknown zone first, the system didn't move anywhere but just spoke. So perhaps in this case, since E5 is valid, I should proceed with navigating there and then inform the user about the Microwaves being invalid.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the user's command was to go to E5 and then find Microwaves. Since both are part of the same instruction, maybe it's better to process each step and handle any errors as they come.\n\nTherefore, my response should be:\n\n1. Navigate to E5 Entrance.\n2. Attempt to navigate from E5 to Microwaves, but since it's invalid, inform the user.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the system can navigate part of the way or must check all waypoints before moving. To avoid confusion and follow the example given, perhaps it's better to only speak about the invalid waypoint without navigating anywhere because the second step is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system should process each action in order, so first navigate to E5 (valid), then attempt to find Microwaves from there (invalid), resulting in an error message after the movement.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Looking at the guidelines again, it says that if any part is ambiguous or invalid, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking. So perhaps navigating to E5 first and then realizing the error is acceptable.\n\nHowever, given the example where the user asked for an unknown zone first, the system didn't move anywhere but just spoke about the invalid waypoint. Therefore, in this case, since Microwaves are invalid, I should not proceed with any navigation but inform the user right away.\n\nWait, that might be inconsistent because E5 is a valid waypoint. Maybe the system processes each step and only stops if a subsequent action can't be completed after the first step is done. So perhaps:\n\n- First, navigate to E5 Entrance (valid).\n- Then, attempt to find Microwaves from there (invalid), so speak about it.\n\nBut in the example given earlier, the user had an invalid waypoint as the first command, and the system didn't move at all. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to process each step individually:\n\n- If a step is valid, perform it.\n- If any step is invalid, don't perform any subsequent steps but inform the user.\n\nBut that might not be the case because in real scenarios, you have to process instructions as given, and sometimes partial execution is needed before realizing an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system should check all waypoints first before executing any actions. But since it's a role of a virtual assistant or similar, I'm not sure if it has that capability.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to process each step individually:\n\n- Attempt to navigate to E5: valid.\n- Then attempt to find Microwaves from there: invalid, so inform user.\n\nTherefore, the response would be:\n\n- First, navigate to E5 and say so.\n- Then, upon attempting to navigate to Microwaves, realize it's invalid and inform the user.\n\nBut since in the initial problem, the user is just given a command without context of previous steps, perhaps the system should process the entire command at once. So if any part is invalid, don't perform any actions but inform the user.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct response would be to inform the user that Microwaves isn't a valid destination, so no movement occurs.\n\nBut in reality, E5 might refer to something else, like an Excel column or row. But perhaps it's meant as a location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"E5\" is a specific place, but without context, it's hard to say. Since the user wrote \"E5 Role,\" perhaps they mean \"the role of E5 in chess\" or similar, but that might be a stretch.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the initial instruction:\n\nThe user provided a query: \"I want to create a role.\" Then, there's an empty line, and then \"Role\".\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. Perhaps the user is asking about creating a role in a system or organization, and they're referring to different levels, like E5 as a rank.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to say. So perhaps the initial query was incomplete.\n\nIn any case, focusing on the second part, where the user wrote \"Role\", which might be a typo or continuation of their thought process.\n\nPerhaps the user intended to ask about creating an E5 role in an organization and provided some text that got cut off.\n\nBut without more context, it's challenging. Therefore, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that the user wants to create a role, perhaps like a job position, and they're asking for assistance in defining or understanding that process.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, my response would be to explain how to create a new role in an organization, including steps like defining responsibilities, required qualifications, collaboration with stakeholders, obtaining approval, and implementing the role.\n</think>\n\nCreating a new role within an organization involves several key steps to ensure it aligns with company goals and effectively integrates into existing structures.
