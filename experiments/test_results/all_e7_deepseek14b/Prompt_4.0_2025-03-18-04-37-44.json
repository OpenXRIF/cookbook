    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Start at the South Entrance and go to the C&D - Coffee Area.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the command. The user is giving me two actions: start at a specific location and then navigate to another waypoint.\n\nStarting with the starting point, \"South Entrance\" should be matched against the available waypoints. Looking through the list, there's indeed a South Entrance with coordinates (2243, 1083). So that part is straightforward.\n\nNext, the destination is \"C&D - Coffee Area.\" I need to check if this exists in the waypoints. From the data provided, yes, there's a \"C&D - Coffee Area\" at (100, 100). \n\nNow, considering the normalization and matching steps as per the instructions, I'll convert both inputs to lowercase, remove any extraneous tokens like building codes or non-essential identifiers. Tokenizing them should give me exact matches for both waypoints.\n\nSo, the actions needed are:\n1. Navigate to South Entrance.\n2. Then navigate to C&D - Coffee Area.\n\nI don't see any unsupported functions here, as \"navigate\" is an allowed action. Also, the commands are clear and unambiguous, so no issues with multiple interpretations or fallbacks.\n\nPutting it all together, the response should include two navigate actions in order, starting from South Entrance to C&D - Coffee Area.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"South Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 2243,\n        \"y\": 1083\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
