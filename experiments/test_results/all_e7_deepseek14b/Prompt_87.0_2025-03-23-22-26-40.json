For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 75\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPrompt: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\"\n",

    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to handle this user prompt: \"Robot, go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes.\" First, let me break down the steps as per the guidelines provided.\n\n1. **Understanding the Command:** The user is telling the robot to navigate to a specific waypoint called \"Temporary Booth\" and then wait there for 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Parsing the Request:** I need to identify each part of the command. The main actions here are navigating and waiting.\n\n3. **Waypoint Matching:** I'll have to check if \"Temporary Booth\" exists in the list of known waypoints. From the data given, I see there's a waypoint named \"Temporary Booth.\" So that's good.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Actions:** Since the command includes two actions\u2014navigate and then wait\u2014I should process them in sequence. The robot will first navigate to the Temporary Booth, then wait for 30 minutes once it arrives.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:** I need to ensure there are no unknown waypoints or unsupported actions here. \"Temporary Booth\" is valid, and both \"navigate\" and \"wait\" are supported functions.\n\n6. **Output Structure:** The response should be an array of actions. First, the navigate action with the correct waypoint details, followed by the wait action with the specified duration.\n\nI think that's all covered. Let me put this together in the required JSON format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"Temporary Booth\",\n                \"x\": 1535,\n                \"y\": 1083\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"wait\",\n            \"input\": 30\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
