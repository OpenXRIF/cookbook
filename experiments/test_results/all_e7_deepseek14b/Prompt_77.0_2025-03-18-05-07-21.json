Next, move to the C&D - Pastry Area and check for expired products. After that, visit the C&D - Coffee Area to confirm cleanliness. Finally, go to the C&D - Hot Food Area and sanitize any open surfaces before returning to the base station.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this prompt where the robot is given a series of instructions starting from \"C&D - Snack Area\" and then moving through several other specific areas in the C&D section. The user wants the robot to perform inspections or tasks at each location before returning to the base.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the starting point: \"C&D - Snack Area.\" From the provided waypoints, there's a \"C&D - Coffee Area\" but not explicitly a \"Snack Area.\" However, there is a \"Shower A,\" which isn't relevant here. Wait, actually, looking back, none of the listed waypoints mention \"Snack Area.\" Hmm, that might be a problem because if the starting location doesn't exist, the robot can't proceed.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me check again. The waypoints include: Coffee, Cold Drink, Pastry, and Shower A. No Snack Area listed. So \"C&D - Snack Area\" isn't a valid waypoint according to the data provided.\n\nBut maybe the user made a typo or is referring to another area that's implied but not explicitly named. Alternatively, perhaps \"Snack Area\" is part of one of the existing waypoints? For example, if \"C&D - Coffee Area\" includes snacks, but that might be stretching it.\n\nGiven the problem statement, the robot should recognize each waypoint by name and perform actions in sequence. Since \"Snack Area\" isn't listed, trying to navigate there would result in an error message.\n\nSo the first step is: starting at C&D - Snack Area. But since this doesn't exist, the robot can't proceed. Therefore, it should output a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all waypoints again:\n\n- Starting Locations: (0,0)\n- Waypoints listed:\n  - C&D - Coffee Area\n  - C&D - Cold Drink Area\n  - C&D - Pastry Area\n  - Shower A\n\nNo Snack Area. So the robot can't start at that location.\n\nTherefore, the response should be an error message indicating that \"C&D - Snack Area\" doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\nThe robot receives a command to start at \"C&D - Snack Area,\" which isn't recognized as a valid waypoint.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Point:** The instruction begins with navigating to \"C&D - Snack Area.\"\n2. **Check Validity of Waypoint:** Reviewing the available waypoints, none match \"C&D - Snack Area.\"\n3. **Determine Appropriate Response:** Since the waypoint is invalid, return an error message.\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
