    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's prompt. The user wrote, \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the system has predefined waypoints listed in the JSON data provided earlier. These include various locations like \"E Roleau Gate,\" \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" etc., but I don't see an \"E7 silent study\" among them. So, my first thought is to check if this waypoint exists.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, when a user provides a command that includes navigating to a specific location, the system should match it against the available waypoints using fuzzy matching steps: normalization, token removal, tokenization, and similarity calculation. If none of the waypoints meet the threshold, the system should respond by telling the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nIn this case, \"E7 silent study\" isn't listed. Even if I try to break it down, \"E7\" might be a building code or room number which, according to step 2 in the advanced fuzzy matching, should be removed as extraneous tokens. So after cleaning, the input becomes \"silent study.\" Looking through the waypoints again, none of them match this.\n\nTherefore, since there's no matching waypoint, the system should output a speak action informing the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
