    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this prompt where the user says, \"Let's check out Novelties store, and then head out South Entrance.\" Hmm, I need to figure out what actions to take based on this. \n\nFirst, let me parse the command. The user wants two things: go to the Novelties store first, then from there, go to the South Entrance. But wait, looking at the waypoints provided, I don't see any called \"Novelties store\" or \"South Entrance.\" Let's double-check.\n\nThe available waypoints are:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - RoboHub Entrance\n- Starting Locations: (0,0)\n  \nWait, that's it? Or maybe there are more. Oh no, the list provided earlier has several, but I need to check if any match \"Novelties\" or \"South Entrance.\" \n\nLooking back, I see waypoints like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - RoboHub Entrance, and others like Starting Locations at (0,0). There's also South Entrance mentioned in the example, but is it one of the provided waypoints? Let me check:\n\nWait, no. The user's waypoint list includes \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"C&D - RoboHub Entrance,\" and some other specific ones, but not \"South Entrance.\" So that means when the user says \"head out South Entrance,\" there might be a matching waypoint, or maybe not.\n\nBut in my initial analysis, I thought \"South Entrance\" isn't listed. Wait, no\u2014the example answer refers to \"RoboHub Entrance,\" so perhaps the South Entrance is another waypoint but it's not present here. Therefore, when the user mentions both \"Novelties store\" and \"South Entrance,\" neither might be in the list.\n\nSo according to the instructions, if a waypoint isn't recognized, I should respond with a speak action saying it doesn't exist. But since there are two waypoints mentioned, I need to process each step.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me look at the provided waypoints again:\n\nLooking back, the user listed several waypoints:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- C&D - RoboHub Entrance\n- Starting Locations: X=0,Y=0\nAnd others like:\n- C&D - Ideas Clinic\nWait no, in the initial list, I see more than that. Let me check.\n\nIn the \"Waypoints\" section above, there are several waypoints listed:\n\n1. C&D - Coffee Area\n2. C&D - RoboHub Entrance\n3. Starting Locations: (0,0)\n4. Other waypoints like C&D - Ideas Clinic and others, but in this specific case, the user's prompt refers to \"Novelties store\" and \"South Entrance.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if any of the waypoints match these terms using fuzzy matching.\n\nFirst step is normalization: convert both user input and waypoint names to lowercase. Then remove extraneous tokens, like building codes or non-essential identifiers at the beginning.\n\nSo for \"Novelties store,\" normalized would be \"novelties store.\" Now, looking through each waypoint name:\n\nLooking at each waypoint's name in lowercase:\n\n- c&d - coffee area\n- c&d - robohub entrance\n- starting locations (0.0, 0.0)\n- others like c&d - ideas clinic, etc.\n\nSo none of these have \"novelties\" or \"store.\" So when the user says to go to Novelties store, it's not a recognized waypoint.\n\nSimilarly, for \"South Entrance,\" normalized is \"south entrance.\" Looking through waypoints:\n\n- robohub entrance\nBut no \"south entrance.\"\n\nTherefore, both waypoints are unknown. But in the prompt, the user says two things: check out Novelties store first, then head out South Entrance.\n\nSince both are invalid, I need to handle each step accordingly.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, when processing commands, we should process them left-to-right. So the first command is to go to Novelties store. If that's unknown, output a speak action saying it doesn't exist. Then, perhaps, proceed to the next instruction? Or if multiple invalid waypoints are present, just return an error.\n\nWait, in the example where both waypoints are invalid, like \"unknown zone\" and \"RoboHub,\" the response is to speak an error message about 'unknown zone' not being a valid waypoint. So I think in this case, since the first command is invalid, we should respond with that error, without proceeding further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process each step, but if any step fails, output the error and stop.\n\nSo in this prompt, the user wants to go to Novelties store (invalid) then South Entrance (also invalid). So for the first part: \"navigate to Novelties store\" is invalid. So I should return a speak action saying that waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, does the instruction say to check each step? Or just process as a single command.\n\nWait, in the prompt, it's two separate actions: first go to Novelties store, then from there go to South Entrance. But since both are invalid, perhaps I should handle them one by one.\n\nBut according to the instructions, when processing commands, if any waypoint is invalid, we output an error and stop processing further steps.\n\nSo in this case, since \"Novelties store\" is not a recognized waypoint, the response should be to speak that it doesn't exist. Then, perhaps, the user can correct their command.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct response is:\n\n- Speak: \"The destination 'Novelties store' does not exist.\"\n</think>\n\nTo address the prompt where the user wants to go to the Novelties store and then the South Entrance, both of which are unrecognized waypoints, we first check if each destination exists. Upon finding neither valid, the appropriate response is:\n\n- **Speak Action:** \"The destination 'Novelties store' does not exist.\"\n\nThis response indicates that the first step in the user's instruction is invalid, so further processing stops here.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Parse the Command:** The user wants to navigate to two locations sequentially.\n2. **Check First Destination:** \"Novelties store\" is not a recognized waypoint.\n3. **Generate Response:** Inform the user that 'Novelties store' does not exist.\n4. **No Further Processing:** Since the first destination is invalid, subsequent steps are not executed.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe assistant responds by indicating that the first destination isn't recognized, halting further actions.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"speak\",\n  \"text\": \"The destination 'Novelties store' does not exist.\"\n}\n```",
