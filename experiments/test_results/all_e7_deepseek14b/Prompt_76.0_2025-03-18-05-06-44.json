    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this prompt: \"Robot, begin security patrol at E5 Entrance and ensure no unauthorized access. Proceed to the Temporary Booth and check for any unattended items. Then, move to the Elevators and verify they are functioning properly. Head over to the Novelties section to monitor activity. Conclude your patrol at the East Entrance and report any unusual findings.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the command into parts. The robot is supposed to start at E5 Entrance, then go to Temporary Booth, then Elevators, then Novelties section, and end at East Entrance.\n\nLooking at the waypoints provided:\n\n1. E5 Entrance isn't listed, but there's an East Entrance available.\n2. Temporary Booth is a valid waypoint.\n3. Elevators aren't mentioned; maybe I need to infer or see if any nearby areas can be considered.\n4. Novelties section isn't listed either.\n\nI should check each part:\n\n- For E5 Entrance: It might be a typo or shorthand for East Entrance, so that's likely the starting point.\n- Temporary Booth is directly available.\n- Elevators aren't in the list, but maybe the robot can navigate to an area where elevators are located. Alternatively, perhaps it's not possible, and the robot should report an error.\n- Novelties section isn't listed either.\n\nWait, but according to the normalization steps, I need to match tokens. \"E5\" might be a code that gets removed, so \"east entrance\" would match East Entrance.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Start at East Entrance (assuming E5 is shorthand).\n2. Go to Temporary Booth.\n3. Then, since Elevators aren't listed, the robot can't proceed there. It should report an error when trying to navigate to Elevators.\n4. Similarly, Novelties section isn't a known waypoint, so another error.\n\nBut in the example answer, they used \"C&D - Coffee Area\" for C and D areas, which was a match because of token presence. So maybe I need to see if any part of \"Elevators\" is present elsewhere or if there's an alternative.\n\nWait, looking at the provided waypoints:\n\n- There's no Elevators listed.\n- The closest might be navigating to a section where elevators are, but since it's not specified, probably can't match.\n\nSo when processing each step after starting at East Entrance:\n\n1. Navigate to Temporary Booth: that's valid.\n2. Next, navigate to Elevators: invalid, so speak the error.\n3. Then, maybe move on or stop.\n\nSimilarly, Novelties section isn't a waypoint, so same issue.\n\nTherefore, the actions would be:\n\n- Start at East Entrance (using \"navigate\" with its coordinates).\n- Then go to Temporary Booth.\n- When trying to go to Elevators, speak an error.\n- The rest of the commands might not execute because of the stop.\n\nSo the response would include navigating to East Entrance and Temporary Booth, then speaking errors for the remaining steps.\n</think>\n\nThe robot processes each command step-by-step, navigating where possible and reporting errors when encountering unknown waypoints.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Starting Point:** The robot begins at E5 Entrance, which is assumed to be East Entrance based on matching tokens after normalization and token removal.\n\n2. **Proceeding to Temporary Booth:** This is a valid waypoint, so the robot navigates there without issues.\n\n3. **Moving to Elevators:** Since Elevators aren't listed as a valid waypoint, the robot can't proceed. It outputs an error message using the speak action.\n\n4. **Heading to Novelties Section:** Similarly, this isn't a valid waypoint, leading to another error message.\n\n5. **Concluding at East Entrance:** The robot would attempt to return but since previous steps failed, it might not continue past the first invalid command.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"East Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Temporary Booth\",\n        \"x\": 196,\n        \"y\": 370\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Elevators' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'Novelties section' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
