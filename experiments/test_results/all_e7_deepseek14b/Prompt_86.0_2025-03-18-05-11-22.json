    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user just told me to navigate to \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" and wait for 15 seconds. I need to figure out how to respond to this.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's a waypoint named \"C&D - Hot Food Area\". Looking at the list provided earlier, I see waypoints like C&D - Coffee Area, C&D - Hot Food isn't listed. Wait, let me double-check. The user input mentions \"Hot Food\", but in the available waypoints, only \"Coffee\" and \"Hot Food Area\" is there? Hmm, actually, no. The waypoint for hot food was mentioned earlier as part of the example, but looking back at the initial data, I see waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area\" and others but not specifically a Hot Food area.\n\nWait, in the user's message, it's written as \"C&D - Hot Food Area\", but from the given data, there's only \"C&D - Coffee Area\". Maybe I misread. Let me check again. The available waypoints include:\n\n- C&D - Coffee Area\n- South Entrance, etc.\n\nNo, I don't see a Hot Food area listed. So if the user is asking for \"C&D - Hot Food Area\", that's not an existing waypoint.\n\nSince it doesn't exist, according to the instructions, I should return a speak action indicating the waypoint doesn't exist. But wait, maybe the user made a typo or there's a similar name. Let me think about fuzzy matching steps.\n\nNormalization: Both inputs are converted to lowercase. The user's input is \"c&d - hot food area\". The known waypoint is \"c&d - coffee area\". So tokenizing both:\n\nUser: [\"c\", \"&\", \"d\", \"-\", \"hot\", \"food\", \"area\"]\nWaypoint: [\"c\", \"&\", \"d\", \"-\", \"coffee\", \"area\"]\n\nComparing tokens, the user's input has \"hot\" and \"food\" instead of \"coffee\". Since none of the waypoint tokens are entirely present, and only some percentage might match, it might not meet the 80% threshold. So likely, no match.\n\nTherefore, I should respond that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
