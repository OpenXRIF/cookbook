    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this user prompt: \"Travel to the E5 Entrance and then find the Microwaves.\" I need to figure out how to respond with the appropriate actions. \n\nFirst, I'll start by normalizing the input. The user wants me to travel to \"E5 Entrance\" and then find \"Microwaves.\" So, I'll convert these to lowercase: \"e5 entrance\" and \"microwaves.\"\n\nNext, I need to remove any extraneous tokens. In this case, \"E5\" seems like a building code or identifier at the beginning of \"E5 Entrance,\" so I should discard it. That leaves me with just \"Entrance\" as the waypoint name.\n\nNow, I'll tokenize both the cleaned input and the known waypoints. The user's input after cleaning is [\"entrance\"], and looking through the provided waypoints, I have \"e5 entrance\" as one of them. \n\nI need to check if all tokens from the waypoint are present in the user's input. The waypoint name \"e5 entrance\" has two tokens: \"e5\" and \"entrance.\" However, since we removed \"e5,\" only \"entrance\" remains, which is present in the user's input. \n\nFor similarity calculation, I'll see that 100% of the cleaned tokens from the waypoint are present in the user's input because \"entrance\" matches exactly. This means it meets the threshold for a match.\n\nSo, the first action is to navigate to \"E5 Entrance.\" Then, the next part of the command is to find \"Microwaves.\" I'll need to check if \"microwaves\" exists as a waypoint. Looking through the provided list, I don't see any waypoints named \"microwaves,\" so it's an unknown.\n\nSince \"microwaves\" isn't found, I should output a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist. Therefore, after navigating to E5 Entrance, the next step is to inform the user about the missing waypoint.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions will first navigate to E5 Entrance and then speak about the unknown Microwaves.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E5 Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 216.0,\n                \"y\": 172.0\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"speak\",\n            \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
