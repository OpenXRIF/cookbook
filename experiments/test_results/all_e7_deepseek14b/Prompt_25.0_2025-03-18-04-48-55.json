    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to freshen up by going to Shower A and then Shower B, waiting a minute at Shower B before moving on. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the command: \"Take me two Shower A, then Shower B. Wait 1 minute at Shower B, then we can go.\" The key parts are the locations (\"Shower A\" and \"Shower B\") and the wait time of one minute at Shower B.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I see that there's a \"Shower A\" listed with coordinates (0.0, 25.0). But I don't see any mention of \"Shower B\" in the provided data. The user might be assuming another shower exists, but based on what I have, Shower B isn't defined.\n\nSo, when processing this command, my first step is to navigate to Shower A. That's straightforward since it's a known waypoint. But then, the next instruction is to go to Shower B, which doesn't exist in our data. Since there's no valid waypoint for Shower B, I can't proceed further without that information.\n\nThe user also wants to wait one minute at Shower B after arriving there. However, because Shower B isn't a recognized location, I can't execute any actions beyond the first navigate command.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, if a waypoint doesn't exist, I should return an action where I speak and inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. In this case, since both parts of the command are invalid after the first step, I should handle the error appropriately.\n\nI think the best course of action is to navigate to Shower A as instructed, then check for Shower B. Since Shower B isn't found, I'll respond by speaking that it doesn't exist and stop there. This way, the user knows their request can't be fully completed due to missing information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Shower A\",\n        \"x\": 0.0,\n        \"y\": 25.0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
