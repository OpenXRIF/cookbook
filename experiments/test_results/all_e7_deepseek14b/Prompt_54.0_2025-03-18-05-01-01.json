    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to handle this prompt. The user said, \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" First, I need to parse the command and identify any waypoints mentioned.\n\nE7 sounds like a building code or identifier, so according to the instructions, I should remove extraneous tokens that are likely just codes. That leaves me with \"silent study.\" Now, I'll look through the list of available waypoints for matches.\n\nLooking at the provided waypoints, there's an \"E Role\" area but nothing about silent studies. The closest match is \"E7 - Silent Study,\" which isn't listed here. Since it doesn't exist in the system, I should respond by letting the user know that waypoint doesn't exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
