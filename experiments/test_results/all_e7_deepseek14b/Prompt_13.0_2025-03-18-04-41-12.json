    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. The user wrote, \"Take my to the HubRobo.\" Hmm, that looks like there might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"take me\" instead of \"take my.\" So, the intended message is probably asking to go to the HubRobo location.\n\nLooking at the provided waypoints, I see names like \"C&D - Coffee Area,\" \"Shower B,\" and others. There's no exact match for \"HubRobo.\" But maybe it's a variation or misspelling of an existing waypoint. Let me check if any of the known waypoints are similar to HubRobo.\n\nThe closest match might be \"RoboHub Entrance\" based on the example provided earlier, but in this case, there isn't a waypoint named RoboHub. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the initial data, I don't see a waypoint named RoboHub or HubRobo. The user might have confused the name.\n\nSince \"HubRobo\" doesn't match any known waypoints, I should trigger the unknown waypoint response. That means I need to return an action where the bot speaks and says that this waypoint doesn't exist.\n\nSo, my response will be a speak action with the message indicating that HubRobo isn't a valid waypoint.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
