For instance, if a token contains both letters and digits and appears at the beginning of the input, discard it.\n\n3. **Tokenization:**\n  Split both the cleaned user input and each known waypoint name into individual words.\n\n4. **Similarity Calculation:**\n  For each known waypoint, assess the match by:\n  - Checking if every token from the waypoint name appears in the user's input.\n  - Alternatively, ensuring that a high percentage (e.g., 80% or more) of the tokens in the waypoint name are present in the input.\n  This allows the input to include additional tokens (such as non-essential prefixes) without preventing a match.\n\n5. **Selection and Fallback:**\n  - If a single waypoint meets or exceeds the similarity threshold, treat it as a match.\n  - If multiple waypoints meet the criteria, select the one with the highest similarity score.\n  - If no known waypoint meets the threshold, output an action with `\"action\": \"speak\"` and the input `\"This waypoint does not exist\"`.\n\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands in a left-to-right sequence unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n- For commands that include multiple steps, output the actions in the order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations exist, choose the interpretation that minimizes backtracking.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- **Unknown Waypoint:** If a waypoint is unknown, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- **Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:** Return a single speak action with an error message.\n- **Unsupported Actions:** If any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\" is requested, return:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Robot, navigate to [[C&D - Hot Food Area]], announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly, and wait until further instructions.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this prompt: \"Robot, navigate to [[C&D - Hot Food Area]], announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly, and wait until further instructions.\"\n\nFirst, the robot needs to understand each part of the command. The first action is navigating to a specific location called \"C&D - Hot Food Area.\" I should check if this waypoint exists in the list provided.\n\nLooking at the waypoints listed, there's an entry for \"C&D - Hot Food Area\" with coordinates x: 0 and y: 0 (though probably needs actual values, but that might be a placeholder). So, yes, it does exist. \n\nNext, after navigating, the robot is supposed to announce the name clearly. The announcement should exactly match the waypoint's name as given, which is \"C&D - Hot Food Area.\" That part seems straightforward.\n\nThen, after announcing, the robot should wait until further instructions. The prompt specifies waiting, but it doesn't give a time duration, so I think the action would just be to wait indefinitely or until another command is received.\n\nI need to structure the response as an array of actions. First, navigate to the waypoint, then speak the announcement, and finally wait. \n\nWait, the original example in the prompt had separate steps: navigating, speaking, waiting. So I should follow that order. The robot must perform each action in sequence without any overlap.\n\nI also need to make sure that the JSON structure is correct, with \"action\" and \"input\" for each step. For navigation, include the waypoint's name and coordinates (though in this case, the x and y are 0, which might not be accurate, but perhaps it's a placeholder).\n\nSo putting it all together: first navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area, then speak the announcement, then wait.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"C&D - Hot Food Area\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"C&D Hot Food Area\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
