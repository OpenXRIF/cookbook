    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's prompt: \"Honestly, I don't like coffee. go to the robohub\". The goal is to generate a proper JSON response based on the given guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding each part of the process as outlined in the problem description.\n\n1. **Normalization:** Both the user's input and waypoint names are converted to lowercase. So, \"robohub\" becomes \"robohub\", and all waypoints are also lowercase.\n\n2. **Extraneous Token Removal:** Remove tokens that look like building codes or non-essential identifiers. For example, if a token starts with letters and has numbers, it might be removed if it's at the beginning. But in this case, the user is just saying \"robohub\", which seems straightforward.\n\n3. **Tokenization:** Split the input into words. The user's input after normalization would be [\"Honestly,\", \"I\", \"don't\", \"like\", \"coffee.\", \"go\", \"to\", \"the\", \"robohub\"]. The relevant part here is \"go to the robohub\".\n\n4. **Matching Waypoints:** I need to check which waypoints match the user's command. From the list, I see there are several waypoints like \"C&D - Coffee Area\", \"RoboHub Entrance\", etc.\n\n5. **Similarity Calculation:** For each waypoint, I check if all tokens of the waypoint are present in the input or if a high percentage (like 80%) matches. The user's command includes \"robohub\" which should match \"RoboHub Entrance\".\n\n6. **Selection:** Since only one waypoint likely matches, it will be selected.\n\n7. **Generating Actions:** The action is to navigate to that waypoint.\n\nI also need to make sure I follow the structure for the response: actions array with each action as an object specifying action type and input.\n\nIn this case, the user is giving a straightforward command after some irrelevant text, so only one navigation action is needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 50\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
