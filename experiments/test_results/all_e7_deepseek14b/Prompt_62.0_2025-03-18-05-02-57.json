    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to handle this user prompt. The user wrote, \"Take me to the E7 silent study.\" I need to determine if this matches any of the predefined waypoints.\n\nFirst, I'll normalize both the input and the waypoint names by converting them to lowercase. So, the input becomes \"e7 silent study.\"\n\nNext, I need to remove any extraneous tokens that might be codes or non-essential identifiers. The user's input starts with \"E7,\" which contains a letter and a digit. According to the instructions, if a token at the beginning has both letters and digits, it should be discarded. So, I'll remove \"e7\" from the input, leaving me with \"silent study.\"\n\nNow, I'll tokenize the cleaned input into individual words: [\"silent\", \"study\"].\n\nI'll compare this against each waypoint name in the list. The available waypoints are:\n\n1. C&D - Coffee Area\n2. C&D - RoboHub Entrance\n3. Ideas Clinic\n4. Starting Locations (0.0, 0.0)\n5. E7 Silent Study\n\nLooking at \"E7 Silent Study,\" after normalization and removing extraneous tokens, it becomes \"silent study.\" This matches exactly with the tokenized input [\"silent\", \"study\"]. \n\nTo ensure a high similarity score, I check if all tokens from the waypoint name are present in the user's input. Here, both \"silent\" and \"study\" are present. Therefore, the similarity is 100%, which exceeds the threshold.\n\nSince there's only one matching waypoint, it's selected without ambiguity. The system should navigate to E7 Silent Study.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"E7 Silent Study\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",
