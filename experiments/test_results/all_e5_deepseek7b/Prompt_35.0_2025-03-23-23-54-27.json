Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n*Below is the users query to respond to*\n\"Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?\"",

    "Prompt": "\"Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. The query is asking, \"Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the waypoints provided in the data. There are several, like the RoboHub Entrance, Idea Studio, etc. But none of them have a name that matches \"Mars Rover bay.\" The closest is the Mars Rover with keywords [\" rover\", \"bay\"] but it's not exactly named as \"bay.\"\n\nNext, I need to check if \"Mars Rover bay\" can be matched by ignoring extra tokens. Since the waypoint's name is \"Mars Rover,\" which doesn't include \"bay,\" and none of the other waypoints have \"Mars Rover\" in their names except for this one. So there's no exact match.\n\nI also need to look at the keywords each waypoint has. Mars Rover's keywords are [\" rover\", \"bay\"], but the waypoint name is \"Mars Rover.\" The user's input doesn't include any extra tokens before \"bay,\" so it might be considered as a separate word. However, since the waypoint's name doesn't have \"bay\" in it and the keyword list includes \"bay,\" maybe it can still match.\n\nWait, no\u2014the rules say that after ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text matches at least one of the keywords or is part of the name. So \"Mars Rover bay\" after ignoring any extra would be \"Mars Rover.\" But since \" rover\" is a keyword and \"bay\" isn't in the name but might be an additional word.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user's request ends with \"bay,\" so if we ignore any possible extra tokens before it, like \"Mars Rover,\" then the remaining would just be \"bay.\" But none of the waypoints have \"bay\" as their name or keyword except Mars Rover, which has \" rover\" and \"bay.\" So maybe after ignoring, since \"bay\" is in the keywords, it can match.\n\nBut wait, the clean input is \"Mars Rover bay\"\u2014if we remove any alphanumeric tokens before \"bay,\" like \"Mars Rover,\" then what remains is just \"bay.\" But that doesn't exactly match any waypoint's name or keyword set. Mars Rover has \" rover\" and \"bay\" as keywords but its name is \"Mars Rover.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to Mars Rover because of the keyword inclusion. So perhaps it's a valid match.\n\nBut looking back at the rules, if after ignoring extra tokens, the input doesn't contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name, then it's invalid. But since \"bay\" is part of the user's input and Mars Rover has \"bay\" as a keyword, maybe it can be matched.\n\nWait, but the clean input would be \"MarsRoverBay\"? No, because we're ignoring extra tokens before \"Mars Rover bay.\" Wait, no\u2014the user's prompt is \"Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?\" So after trimming any extra tokens at the beginning, which there are none, it becomes \"Mars Rover bay.\"\n\nNow, checking if this matches any waypoint. The waypoints have names like \"Idea Studio,\" \"RoboHub Entrance,\" etc., and Mars Rover's name is just that. The user input is \"MarsRoverbay\"\u2014no, wait, the user wrote \"MarsRover bay.\" Wait, no, in the data, there's a waypoint called Mars Rover with keywords rover and bay.\n\nWait, but the clean input after trimming extra tokens at the beginning would be \"MarsRoverBay,\" right? Or is it just \"MarsRover\" because we're ignoring any tokens before \"bay\"?\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you ignore extra tokens, you remove them from the beginning. So if the user's input starts with some alphanumeric code followed by \"Mars Rover bay,\" those initial codes are ignored, leaving just \"MarsRoverBay.\" But none of the waypoints have that exact name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user didn't include any extra tokens before \"Mars Rover bay,\" so the clean input is exactly \"MarsRover bay.\" Then, checking if this matches any waypoint's name or keywords. MarsRover's name is just MarsRover, and its keywords are rover and bay. The clean input includes both rover (since MarsRover has rover as a keyword) and bay as a separate word.\n\nWait, but the clean input is \"MarsRover bay.\" Does that match any waypoint? MarsRover's name doesn't include \"bay,\" but it does have \"bay\" as a keyword. So perhaps it can be considered a valid match because \"bay\" is part of the keywords.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the name isn't an exact match, so even though \"bay\" is present in the keywords, since the name doesn't include it, it's not a match.\n\nWait, no\u2014the rules say that if after trimming extra tokens at the beginning, the remaining text matches any keyword or part of the name. So MarsRover has \" rover\" as a keyword and \"bay\" also is a keyword, but the name is \"MarsRover.\"\n\nSo in this case, since the user's input includes both MarsRover (name) and bay (keyword), maybe it can be considered a match because part of the clean input (\"bay\") matches one of the keywords.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again: the user's prompt is \"MarsRover bay.\" After trimming extra tokens, which are none in this case, we get \"MarsRoverBay\"\u2014but that's not a waypoint name. Alternatively, if it's just \"MarsRover\" followed by \"bay,\" then MarsRover has \" rover\" as a keyword and \"bay\" as another keyword. So the clean input would include both, making it a valid match.\n\nTherefore, perhaps this can be considered as a valid match to MarsRover waypoint because \"bay\" is one of its keywords.\n\nSo the next step is to check if there's only one matching waypoint. Since MarsRover is the only one with \"bay\" in its keyword list, and no other waypoints have bay except MarsRover, it should be fine.\n\nOnce matched, I'll return the corresponding response.\n</think>\n\nThe user requested a navigation to \"Mars Rover bay.\" Upon examining the provided waypoints, we find that while MarsRover has \" rover\" as a keyword and \"bay\" listed under its keywords, its name is simply \"MarsRover.\" The user's input after trimming extra tokens at the beginning would be \"MarsRover bay,\" which includes both the name and one of the keywords. Therefore, it can be considered a valid match.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe navigation destination is MarsRover, as per the provided data. Here are the directions:\n\n1. Start by moving to the MarsRover location.\n2. Proceed towards the bay area within MarsRover.\n3. Complete the journey accordingly.\n\nThis response aligns with the keywords and name of MarsRover in the waypoints.",
