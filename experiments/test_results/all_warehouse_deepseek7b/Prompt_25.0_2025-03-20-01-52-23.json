The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to each kind of washer.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: \"Take me to each kind of washer.\" Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user wants to be taken to each type of washer. From the given data, there are several waypoints in section A with different codes and coordinates. Each seems to have a specific size or type of washer based on their names like \"M6\", \"1/4\", etc.\n\nI remember that the robot can navigate to these points, but it needs to do so sequentially. So, I should list all the relevant waypoints and then create actions for each one.\n\nWait, in the examples provided, when multiple items are requested, the robot navigates to each location one after another. But in this case, since the user is asking to be taken to each kind of washer, it's about moving the robot to each location where different washers are stored.\n\nI should check if all these waypoints exist and have valid coordinates. From the data, A-06-125, A-07-130, etc., are present with their respective x and y values.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the robot doesn't get lost or stuck in a loop. So, each navigate action should be followed by moving to the next point without returning to the starting point until all have been visited.\n\nWait, but in the initial response, after visiting A-06-125, it navigates back to the starting point, then goes to A-07-130 again. That doesn't seem efficient because it's going back and forth repeatedly instead of moving sequentially to each location once.\n\nI think a better approach would be to have the robot move from one washer location to another in order without returning to the start until all have been visited. But according to the example given, when multiple items are requested, the robot goes to each container and then returns home. Maybe in this case, since it's about different kinds of washers, the robot should visit each one individually and return after each, but that would be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just wants the information about where each washer is located without physically moving there multiple times. But the initial response seems to suggest physical movement.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples, when a single item was requested, the robot went to that location, spoke, then returned. For multiple items, it's not clear from the examples how to handle sequential navigation. However, in the first example, after retrieving the item, it returned home, so perhaps for each washer type, it should go there, speak about it, and return before moving on to the next.\n\nBut that would be time-consuming, especially if there are many washers. Alternatively, maybe just list all the locations without movement because the user is asking to be taken there. Wait, no\u2014the response in the example includes navigate actions with specific points, so perhaps I should do the same.\n\nWait, but in this case, the user says \"Take me to each kind of washer.\" So, it's about moving the robot to each location where different washers are stored. But since the robot can't be in multiple places at once, maybe the response is just informing the user about all the locations, not physically moving.\n\nBut looking back at the examples, when a single item was requested, the robot navigated to that point and then returned home after speaking. So perhaps for each washer type, it should navigate there, speak, then return. But with multiple points, this would result in many actions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just list all the locations where washers are stored without movement because the user is asking for information on where each kind is located.\n\nBut in the initial response, the robot navigated to A-06-125, spoke about it, then returned home. Then it navigated again to A-07-130\u2014wait, no, actually, looking at the initial response, after navigating to A-06-125 and speaking, it went back home, then perhaps that's all because the rest of the actions might be cut off.\n\nWait, in the initial response provided by the user, after the first navigate action, there are only two actions: speak and navigate back. So maybe the system only handles one point and doesn't continue to others.\n\nBut according to the user's query, they asked for each kind of washer, so I need to make sure that all relevant waypoints are included. Therefore, the correct response should involve navigating to each of these points in sequence, speaking about each one, then returning home after each visit.\n\nSo, the actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to A-06-125\n2. Speak about 3/8 washers\n3. Return home\n4. Navigate to A-07-130\n5. Speak about 1/4 washers\n6. Return home\n7. And so on for each washer type.\n\nBut that would result in a lot of actions, which might not be ideal. Alternatively, perhaps just provide the information verbally without moving, but according to the examples, movement is involved when items are requested.\n\nWait, looking back at the example response: after navigating to A-06-125, it spoke and then returned home. So perhaps for each washer type, a separate navigate action is needed. Therefore, the initial response should include all these actions in sequence.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the system can handle multiple navigate actions without returning home each time. Maybe it's better to list all the locations first before any movement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know where each kind of washer is located, so the robot should just speak about each location without moving. But that contradicts the example where movement was involved.\n\nI think the correct approach is to navigate to each location one by one, speak about it, then return home before moving on to the next. So for each washer type, there would be three actions: go there, speak, come back.\n\nBut considering the initial response only included two washers, maybe I need to include all of them in the same way.\n</think>\n\nThe user's request is to \"Take me to each kind of washer.\" Based on the provided data and examples, the appropriate response involves navigating to each location where different types of washers are stored. Each navigation should be followed by a spoken announcement about the washers available there, then returning home before proceeding to the next location.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Locations:** Determine all waypoints in section A that contain washers, noting their specific sizes or types.\n2. **Sequence Navigation Actions:** For each washer type, create a navigate action to its location, followed by a speak action, and then returning home.\n3. **Execute Each Action Sequentially:** Ensure each set of actions (navigate, speak, return) is executed in order without skipping steps.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigateTo\",\n      \"value\": \"A-06-125\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"speak\",\n      \"value\": \"This location contains 3/8 washers.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigateHome\",\n      \"value\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigateTo\",\n      \"value\": \"A-07-130\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"speak\",\n      \"value\": \"This location contains 1/4 washers.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigateHome\",\n      \"value\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
