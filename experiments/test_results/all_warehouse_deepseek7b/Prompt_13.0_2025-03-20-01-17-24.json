The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Experiment ID": 2.0,
    "Prompt ID": 13.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Go get me a M6x1.0-60mm.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to handle this user's request: \"Go get me a M6x1.0-60mm.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is asking for a specific item, which seems to be a bolt or nut of some sort. The way they phrased it, \"M6x1.0-60mm,\" suggests they're referring to a metric screw or bolt. In standard terms, this would typically be written as M6 x 1.0 mm length, but the user wrote it as M6x1.0-60mm. That might mean they actually want a 60mm long bolt with a 1.0mm diameter thread? Wait, that doesn't quite make sense because usually, the thread is specified after the diameter. So maybe they meant an M6 bolt (which has a 6mm diameter) with a 1.0mm pitch and a length of 60mm.\n\nLooking at the provided data, I see there are several containers in section A, each containing different sizes of bolts or nuts. Let me list them out:\n\n- A-02-002: M8 locknuts (probably size M8)\n- A-03-001: 1/4\" hex head bolts\n- A-05-003: 3/8\" carriage bolts\n- A-07-004: M6 x 1.0mm bolts\n\nWait, the user is asking for \"M6x1.0-60mm.\" The container A-07-004 has M6 x 1.0mm bolts, but I don't know their length. Since the user specified 60mm, which isn't listed in any of the containers, that's a problem.\n\nI should check if there's any container with M6 bolts of 60mm length. From the data given, none of them have that exact size. The closest is A-07-004, which has M6 x 1.0mm, but the length isn't specified as 60mm.\n\nSo when I process this request, I need to see if \"M6x1.0-60mm\" matches any of the existing containers. Since it doesn't, I should respond that the item doesn't exist in the requested container.\n\nI'll structure my response by first trying to navigate to the container specified (if any), but since the user didn't specify a container code, only the item, I might need to check all containers or see if they mentioned a section. In this case, it's not provided, so perhaps the system will look for the item across all sections.\n\nBut in the example given, when the user asked for \"M6-1.0x55mm\" bolts from A-01-001 and that container didn't have them, the response was an error message. Similarly, here, since no container has M6x1.0-60mm bolts, I should output an error.\n\nSo the actions would be to speak a message indicating the item doesn't exist in any of the containers or specifically in the requested one.\n</think>\n\nThe user's request for \"M6x1.0-60mm\" does not match any available container. Here is the structured response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'M6x1.0-60mm' does not exist in any container.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response informs the user that their requested item isn't available, ensuring clarity and correctness based on the provided data.",
