The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to an impact and a compatible battery.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: \"Take me to an impact and a compatible battery.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the supported waypoints provided in the problem. The available waypoint names are:\n\n- A-01-001\n- A-02-001\n- B-04-075\n- C-06-161\n\nEach of these has specific items associated with them based on their codes.\n\nThe user is asking for two things: an impact and a compatible battery. I need to determine which waypoints have both items mentioned in their details or keywords.\n\nLooking at the way points:\n\nA-01-001: Contains M8 locknuts, not impacts or batteries.\nA-02-001: Includes wrenches but no impact or battery info.\nB-04-075: The code here is B-04-075. Looking at the problem statement, this waypoint includes an impact. So that's one part of what the user needs.\n\nC-06-161: This has windshield wiper fluid and a starting point, no battery info.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for both an impact and a compatible battery. I need to check if any other waypoints have both or at least another with a compatible battery.\n\nLooking again:\n\nB-04-075's description says \"Impact\", which likely refers to a drill bit or impact tool, not necessarily a battery. So maybe the user needs a separate way point for the battery.\n\nBut looking through the provided way points, I don't see any other waypoint that includes both an impact and a battery. Only B-04-075 has an impact, but there's no mention of a compatible battery in it or elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user says \"Take me to an impact and a compatible battery.\" So perhaps the impact is one way point, and then another for the battery?\n\nBut the problem only provides four way points. Let me check each again:\n\n- A-01-001: M8 locknuts\n- A-02-001: Wrenches\n- B-04-075: Impact (maybe a drill or tool)\n- C-06-161: Windshield wiper fluid and starting point\n\nHmm, so none of the way points have both an impact and a battery. So maybe the user is asking for two separate items.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps only B-04-075 has an impact, but no compatible battery in any other waypoint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if \"compatible battery\" refers to another way point code. For example, does any of the waypoints have a battery?\n\nLooking at each:\n\nA-01-001: No.\nA-02-001: No.\nB-04-075: Impact but no battery.\nC-06-161: No.\n\nSo none of them mention a compatible battery. That's an issue because the user is asking for both, and neither is present in any way point.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem might be that only B-04-075 has an impact, but no battery. So perhaps the answer is to navigate to B-04-075 because it's the closest related item, and then the user would have to handle getting a battery separately.\n\nBut since the user wants both, and there isn't a way point that includes both, I might need to respond accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"impact\" refers to a tool, which could be in B-04-075, but no battery is present. So perhaps it's impossible with the given waypoints because we don't have one that includes both items.\n\nTherefore, the response should inform the user that there isn't an available way point that contains both an impact and a compatible battery.\n</think>\n\nThe request to \"Take me to an impact and a compatible battery\" cannot be fulfilled as no waypoint contains both items. The only relevant waypoint is B-04-075, which includes an impact.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. Navigate to the available way point for the impact tool (B-04-075).\n2. Inform the user that a compatible battery isn't available in this location.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"B-04-075\",\n        \"x\": 1080,\n        \"y\": 30\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"The impact tool is available at B-04-075.
