The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts, then take me to the M6 steel nuts, then let's grab some M6 washers.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user is asking the robot to do a few things: first, take them to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts, then to the M6 steel nuts, and finally grab some M6 washers.\n\nOkay, let's break it down step by step. First, I need to understand what each part of the command means. The robot needs to navigate to specific containers based on the items mentioned.\n\nStarting with \"Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts.\" From the data provided, the containers are in section A. Looking at the available containers, there's A-04-032 which has M6x1.0-25mm bolts. So that seems like the right place for the first part of the command.\n\nNext, after getting the bolts, the user says \"then take me to the M6 steel nuts.\" I'm not seeing any containers listed with M6 steel nuts specifically. The available nuts are just \"M6 nuts\" in A-03-150. Since it's a close match and likely refers to the same type, I think it's safe to assume that's where they want to go next.\n\nThen, the user says \"let's grab some M6 washers.\" Again, looking at the containers, there's no specific mention of M6 washers. However, A-02-100 has washers without a specified size. It might be a bit ambiguous, but since it's an example and assuming they're all M6 related, I'll proceed to that container.\n\nThe robot needs to process each command sequentially: first navigate to the bolts, then to the nuts, then to the washers. After each navigation, it should confirm by speaking the item it would pick up, except for the last one where it just grabs them and returns without further confirmation.\n\nI also need to make sure that after each task, the robot navigates back to the starting point. So after each item is picked up, the robot goes back home before moving on to the next destination.\n\nWait, but looking at the response example provided, in similar cases, the robot only speaks once upon arrival and then returns. Maybe I should follow that pattern: navigate, speak, then return to start after each step.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the nuts and washers are actually present in those containers. If not, maybe the robot should inform the user, but since the example assumes they do, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and considered possible ambiguities. Now, structuring the actions: each navigation followed by a speak action to confirm, then returning home before moving on.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"A-04-032\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 25\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Would pick up M6x1.0-25mm bolts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Starting Point\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"A-03-150\",\n        \"x\": 150,\n        \"y\": 20\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Would pick up M6 steel nuts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Starting Point\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"A-02-100\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 20\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Would grab M6 washers.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Starting Point\",\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 0\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
