The keywords associated with each container denote the items stored within it, as well as possible alternative names or common mis-typings for the container itself. This means that when a user makes a request, they might refer to the items in the container or the container itself.\nAvailable Functions: navigate, speak, and wait.\n\n\n# Understanding User Prompts - Enhanced Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching\nWhen interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:\n\nIgnore Extra Tokens:\n\n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric warehouse code, shipment ID, or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"WH-A12 B-86-109\" as \"B-86-109\".\n\nKeyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors:\n\n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords.\n  - The input must include a significant part of the keyword (75%) or a significant part of the waypoint\u2019s code or aditionally pass your own judgement as being simmilar.\n  - Because human error is common (e.g., typos or misnaming) , apply a tolerant matching approach where you ignore - and spaces or missing a code by one letter (e.g., WA-A12 B86-109  would be the same as WH-A12 B-86-109). However, if the intended waypoint cannot be confidently inferred due to ambiguous or conflicting keywords, determine the reference as invalid.\n  - Note that the users Querey may refer to the items within the container or the container itself its important that you check the waypoint name and the keywords.\n  - Only if the cleaned input includes a distinct subset of the defined keywords or code fragments that clearly point to one available waypoint should it be accepted.\n  - in cases where you are unsure or there are multiple options that fit you may use your own judgment for example (if the user asks for a washer and there are two differnt kinds you may select the one that makes the most sense and bring it)\nStrict Match Requirement:\n\n  After Strictly following the rules set out in 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: and you cant determine the waypoint then the reference is considered invalid.\n  \n\nInvalid Waypoint Response:\n\n  If none of the available waypoints meet the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\nProcess commands sequentially in the order provided.\nFor multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\nIf multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions and avoids misnaming due to human error.\n\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\nUnknown or Misnamed Waypoint:\n\n  If, after following the steps outlined in section 2. Keyword Matching with Tolerance for Errors: the input does not include a clear reference to any waypoint, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nAmbiguous or Invalid Commands:\n\n  Output a single speak action with a clear error message.\nUnsupported Actions:\n\n  If the request includes any function beyond navigate, speak, or wait, output:\n  {\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"action\": \"speak\",\n        \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n# Examples\nInput: \"Could you grab some windshield wiper fluid?

    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts, then let's grab some M6 washers and nuts for it too.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command: \"Take me to the M6x1.0-25mm bolts, then let's grab some M6 washers and nuts for it too.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the request into parts. The user wants two things done sequentially: go to a specific container for bolts and then get washers and nuts from another container.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints provided earlier, there are several containers in section A with different codes and coordinates. Each has items related to M6 bolts but with varying lengths and other components.\n\nThe first part of the request is about M6x1.0-25mm bolts. From the data, I see that container A-03-199 holds M6x1.0-25mm bolts at coordinates (1990, 90). So, the robot should navigate there.\n\nAfter retrieving the bolts, the user wants to grab M6 washers and nuts. The available containers for these are A-04-301 and A-05-305. Both have different items: A-04 has M6 washers, and A-05 has M6 nuts. So, I need to decide which container to go to next.\n\nSince the user mentioned both washers and nuts, the robot should visit both containers. However, since each navigate action can only target one location at a time, it would make sense to first go to A-04 for washers and then to A-05 for nuts. Alternatively, if the robot can carry multiple items in one trip, but based on the examples provided, each step is separate.\n\nWait, looking back at the example given, when the user asked for two items, the response only navigated once. So perhaps I should check if both washers and nuts are present in a single container or if they're in different ones.\n\nIn this case, the washers are in A-04-301, and nuts are in A-05-305. So, the robot needs to go to each one separately after the bolts.\n\nBut let's check the structure of the response. The user's example shows that for multiple items, they might be retrieved in a single step if possible. However, since each container is different, it would require two navigate actions: first to A-03-199 for bolts, then to A-04-301 for washers, and then to A-05-305 for nuts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the robot can handle this in a single trip if all three items are in one place. But from the data given, they're in different containers.\n\nSo, the actions would be:\n\n1. Navigate to A-03-199 (M6x1.0-25mm bolts).\n2. Speak confirmation.\n3. Navigate back to starting point? Or proceed to next container.\n\nWait, but after taking the bolts, the robot needs to go to another container for washers and nuts. So it would be:\n\n1. Go to A-03-199, pick up bolts.\n2. Then go to A-04-301 for washers.\n3. Then go to A-05-305 for nuts.\n\nBut each of these steps requires navigating from the starting point or from one container to another. However, the example shows that after retrieving an item, it navigates back to the starting point before moving on. But in this case, since it's a single command with two parts, maybe it should go sequentially without returning to start in between.\n\nWait, looking at the first example, when the robot goes to a container and then returns to the starting point after speaking. So perhaps each retrieve step is followed by returning home before the next action.\n\nAlternatively, the robot can make multiple trips: go to A-03-199, return home; then go to A-04-301, return home; then go to A-05-305, return home. But that would be inefficient and unnecessary if all items are in section A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the robot can go to each container one after another without returning home between. So:\n\n1. Navigate to A-03-199.\n2. Speak about bolts.\n3. Then navigate to A-04-301 for washers.\n4. Speak about washers.\n5. Then navigate to A-05-305 for nuts.\n6. Speak about nuts.\n7. Finally, return home.\n\nThis seems logical as it minimizes the number of moves.\n\nBut I need to check if each container is indeed present and has the required items. From the data provided:\n\nA-03-199: M6x1.0-25mm bolts \u2013 yes.\n\nA-04-301: M6 washers \u2013 yes.\n\nA-05-305: M6 nuts \u2013 yes.\n\nSo, all three items are in separate containers within section A. Therefore, the robot should navigate to each one in sequence.\n\nBut wait, the user's command is to first go to the bolts and then grab the washers and nuts. So perhaps after retrieving the bolts, it goes to both washer and nut containers. But since they're separate, two more steps are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the washers and nuts are in the same container? Looking back, no\u2014each has different items.\n\nTherefore, the response should include navigating to A-03-199, then A-04-301, then A-05-305, each time speaking about the respective item, and finally returning home after each retrieval or after all are done.\n\nBut in the examples, each retrieve is followed by a return home. So perhaps the robot should go to each container one at a time, pick up the items, speak confirmation, then return home before moving on.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\n1. Go to A-03-199.\n2. Speak about bolts.\n3. Return home.\n4. Go to A-04-301.\n5. Speak about washers.\n6. Return home.\n7. Go to A-05-305.\n8. Speak about nuts.\n9. Return home.\n\nBut that might be overkill, as the user's command is a single request, not multiple separate ones. Alternatively, perhaps it's treated as a single task where the robot goes through each container in one go without returning home until all items are retrieved.\n\nHowever, based on the example provided earlier, the response was to navigate to the specific container and then back home after speaking, implying that each retrieve is an independent action.\n\nIn this case, since the user's command includes two parts (bolts and then washers/nuts), it might be treated as a single task where all items are retrieved in one go. But I'm not sure if the robot can carry multiple items without returning home. Therefore, to play it safe, perhaps each retrieve is done separately with return trips.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the robot should first go to A-03-199 for bolts, then from there directly to A-04-301 and A-05-305 without going back home in between. That would be more efficient but might complicate the path planning beyond the scope of the examples given.\n\nGiven that the user's example had a single navigate action followed by return, I think each retrieve should be its own step with a return home. Therefore, the response will involve three navigate actions, each followed by speaking and returning home.\n\nSo the final response would include:\n\n1. Navigate to A-03-199, speak about bolts, return home.\n2. Navigate to A-04-301, speak about washers, return home.\n3. Navigate to A-05-305, speak about nuts, return home.\n\nBut the user's command is a single sentence, so perhaps it should be treated as a multi-step action without returning home between steps. Therefore, after retrieving the bolts, proceed directly to get washers, then nuts, and finally return home once all are retrieved.\n\nThis would make the response more efficient but requires assuming the robot can handle multiple items or at least plan a path that visits multiple containers in one trip.\n\nIn conclusion, the most logical approach is to navigate sequentially to each container for the required items without returning home until all are collected.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Required Items:** The user needs M6x1.0-25mm bolts, M6 washers, and M6 nuts.\n\n2. **Locate Containers with Required Items:**\n   - Bolts: A-03-199 (M6x1.0-25mm)\n   - Washers: A-04-301 (M6)\n   - Nuts: A-05-305 (M6)\n\n3. **Plan Efficient Navigation:** Visit each container in sequence without returning home between retrieves to minimize travel distance.\n\n4. **Execute Navigation and Retrieval:**\n   - Navigate to A-03-199, retrieve bolts, speak confirmation.\n   - Proceed to A-04-301, retrieve washers, speak confirmation.\n   - Proceed to A-05-305, retrieve nuts, speak confirmation.\n\n5. **Return Home After All Retrievals:** Ensure the robot returns home once all items are collected.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe robot will navigate sequentially to each container in section A to retrieve the required items without returning home between each retrieval, then return home after all items have been collected.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigate\",\n      \"object\": \"container_A-03-199\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"speak\",\n      \"sentence\": \"I retrieved the M6x1.0-25mm bolts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigate\",\n      \"object\": \"container_A-04-301\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"speak\",\n      \"sentence\": \"I retrieved the M6 washers.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigate\",\n      \"object\": \"container_A-05-305\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"speak\",\n      \"sentence\": \"I retrieved the M6 nuts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verb\": \"navigate\",\n      \"object\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
