# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query: ""Take me to the Formula Electric Mech Bay."" 

First, I'll break down the request. The main part here is ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" I should check if this matches any of the predefined waypoints.

Looking at the list provided, there's a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords like ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team."" There's also ""Formula Electric"" which has its own set of keywords. Wait, actually, let me look again. 

Wait, I see that ""Concrete Canoe"" is one waypoint, but I don't immediately see a ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Maybe the user made a typo or combined terms from different waypoints.

Looking through the waypoints:

- Formula Electric has keywords: [""formula"", ""electric"", ""car"", ""design"", ""team""]
- The Mech Bay might be part of another waypoint. Let me check each one.

Wait, I don't see a waypoint named ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" But there is a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" and another called ""Mechanical Engineering Lab,"" perhaps? Or maybe not. 

Wait, no, looking back, the waypoints listed are:

- Starting Location
- Formula Electric
- Role
- Concrete Canoe

Hmm, actually, I might have missed it earlier. Let me go through each waypoint again.

Wait, the user's query is ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" But in the provided waypoints, there's a waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe"" and another named ""Mechanical Engineering Lab"" perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait no, looking back:

The user provided a list of waypoints including:

- Formula Electric
- Starting Location
- Available Functions
- Other waypoints like Concrete Canoe, etc.

Wait, actually, I think I might have misread earlier. The user's message includes waypoints with names like ""Formula Electric"" and others, but not specifically ""Mech Bay."" 

So when the user says ""Formula Electric Mech Bay,"" after ignoring extra tokens, it becomes ""formula electric mech bay."" Now, checking each waypoint:

1. For ""Formula Electric"": keywords include formula, electric, car, design, team. The name is ""Formula Electric."" So if the cleaned input includes ""formula"" or ""electric,"" this could match.

2. The user's cleaned input is ""formula electric mech bay."" Now, does ""mech bay"" correspond to any keyword? Looking through all waypoints:

- Formula Electric has keywords that don't include ""mech"" or ""bay.""
- Other waypoints like ""Mechanical Engineering Lab"" might have those terms, but I don't see such a waypoint in the list provided.

Wait, let me check again. The user's waypoints are:

1. Starting Location
2. Formula Electric (keywords: formula, electric, car, design, team)
3. Role (probably not relevant here)
4. Concrete Canoe (keywords: concrete, canoe, design team)
5. Other waypoints like Mechanical Engineering Lab? No, I don't see that in the list.

Wait, perhaps ""Mech Bay"" is part of another waypoint's keywords or name. Let me check each one:

- Formula Electric: no
- Others: none seem to have ""mech"" or ""bay.""

So, after cleaning, the input is ""formula electric mech bay."" Now, looking for any waypoint that includes either its name or keywords matching this.

""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" doesn't match any exact waypoint names. The closest is ""Formula Electric,"" but does ""mech bay"" relate to it? The keywords for Formula Electric are formula, electric, car, design, team. None of these include ""mech"" or ""bay.""

Therefore, since the cleaned input doesn't contain any keywords from any other waypoints beyond ""formula"" and ""electric,"" which match Formula Electric, but the rest (""mech bay"") don't point to another waypoint.

So, does this mean it's ambiguous? Because after cleaning, the input is ""formula electric mech bay."" The first part matches Formula Electric, but then there's ""mech bay."" Since no other waypoint includes ""mech"" or ""bay,"" maybe it's still considered a match for Formula Electric because at least one keyword is present.

Wait, according to rule 3, the cleaned input must contain at least one keyword from the waypoint and must clearly point to one single waypoint. If the cleaned input contains multiple keywords that could map to different waypoints, but in this case, only ""formula"" and ""electric"" are present, which belong to Formula Electric.

The rest of the query, ""mech bay,"" doesn't match any other waypoint's name or keywords. So, it's possible that the user intended Formula Electric, even though they added ""mech bay."" 

Alternatively, maybe ""mech bay"" is part of another waypoint's name or keywords, but since I don't see such a waypoint in the list provided, I have to assume it doesn't exist.

Therefore, the best match is Formula Electric. So, the response should be to navigate to Formula Electric.
</think>

The user's query is ""Take me to the Formula Electric Mech Bay."" After analyzing the predefined waypoints and applying the given rules, the appropriate response is:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Clean the Input:** The cleaned version of ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" is ""formula electric mech bay.""

2. **Match Keywords and Waypoints:**
   - Check each waypoint for a match with the cleaned input.
   - ""Formula Electric"" matches because it contains the keywords ""formula"" and ""electric.""
   - No other waypoints include ""mech"" or ""bay,"" so no additional matches are found.

3. **Determine Ambiguity:**
   - The query partially matches ""Formula Electric"" but includes terms not associated with any other waypoint.
   - Since only one waypoint (Formula Electric) is identified, it's considered a clear match despite the extra terms.

**Answer:**

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's request. The user says, ""By car is dirty, take me to the washbay."" First, I should parse this sentence to understand what they're asking for.

The main part of their message is about taking them to the washbay. So, I'm looking for a waypoint that matches ""washbay"". Let's check the list of waypoints provided.

Looking through the waypoints, there's one called ""Wash Bay"" with the name ""WashBay"" and keywords like ""car"", ""wash"", and ""bay"". The user's command mentions ""washbay"", which seems to directly relate to this waypoint. 

I need to make sure that according to the rules, I ignore any extra tokens, but in this case, the user isn't using any extra prefixes or codes. So, ""take me to the washbay"" is clean.

Next, I check if ""washbay"" contains at least one of the keywords from the WashBay waypoint. The keywords are ""car"", ""wash"", and ""bay"". The word ""washbay"" includes ""wash"" as part of it, so that's a match. Also, the name itself has ""WashBay"", which is related.

Since there's only one waypoint that matches these criteria, I can confidently navigate to WashBay. There are no other waypoints with similar keywords or names that could cause ambiguity.

I also need to ensure that the command doesn't include any unsupported actions. The user just wants to be navigated to a location, so ""navigate"" is the appropriate action here.

So, the response should be a single navigate action to the WashBay waypoint.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }

Okay, let's try to figure out what the user is asking for. They say, ""I need a big space to work, and you take me to an open space?"" So, they're looking for a place with lots of room.

First, I'll look through all the waypoints provided to see which ones might match. The keywords associated with each waypoint could help here. For example, if there's a waypoint named ""open area"" or something similar, that would be perfect.

I check the list and notice none of the waypoints explicitly mention ""big space,"" ""open space,"" or related terms in their names or keywords. All the waypoints are more specific, like ""Concrete Canoe"" or ""C&D - Coffee Area."" These don't fit the user's request for a general open area.

Since there’s no matching waypoint, I need to respond that the requested location doesn't exist. The instructions say if none of the waypoints match, output an error message saying so.
</think>

The user is asking to be taken to an open space but none of the available waypoints correspond to such a location based on the provided keywords.

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Alright, let's break down how I approached this problem. The user asked, ""Isn't there a quiet chamber around here, where is that?"" My goal was to determine if this query matches any of the predefined waypoints based on their keywords.

First, I ignored any extra tokens and focused on the core request: ""quiet chamber."" I checked each waypoint's name and associated keywords. The available waypoints included places like E7 - Ideas Clinic with keywords like ""ideas,"" ""clinic,"" and ""room,"" but none related to ""quiet"" or ""chamber.""

I considered variations, like if ""quiet"" could match any keyword, but none of the waypoints had those terms. Since no waypoint matched, I concluded it was invalid.

Finally, I responded by telling the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's question: ""Do you know where the machine shop is?"" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They're looking for directions or information about the location of a machine shop. So, my response should help them navigate there if possible.

Looking at the provided waypoints, I see that ""Machine Shop"" isn't listed among them. The available waypoints include places like E7 Ideas Clinic, C&D - Coffee Area, and others, but not the Machine Shop. 

Next, I have to check the rules for matching keywords. Each waypoint has specific keywords associated with it. Since ""machine shop"" doesn't match any of these keywords or the waypoint names provided, there's no valid waypoint that fits this query.

I also need to consider if the user might have made a typo or used an abbreviation. But even then, none of the available waypoints seem related. For example, ""shop"" isn't part of any keyword for the listed points.

According to the rules, if the cleaned input doesn't match any keywords or waypoint names, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. So, in this case, I have to inform the user that the machine shop isn't a valid location based on the given data.

I shouldn't suggest any other locations because it's not part of the instructions to infer alternative possibilities. My role is strictly to match keywords and available waypoints accurately.

Therefore, my response should be clear and direct, letting the user know that the requested waypoint isn't found in the system.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query: ""Do you know where the welding room is?"" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read through all the provided waypoint data. There are several waypoints listed with their names and corresponding keywords. My task is to determine if any of these match the user's request for the welding room.

The user mentioned ""welding room,"" so I'm looking for a waypoint that includes ""welding"" or similar terms in its keywords. Looking through the list, I see entries like ""Welding Lab"" with keywords [""welding"", ""lab"", ""tools""]. That seems relevant.

I should check if there are any other waypoints that might match. Scanning through, none of the others seem to include welding-related terms. So, it's clear that ""Welding Lab"" is the intended waypoint.

Next, I need to construct the response based on the guidelines. Since the waypoint exists, the actions array should include a navigate action to the Welding Lab with its coordinates.

I also need to ensure the JSON structure is correct, using proper indentation and syntax. The response should be concise, just navigating to the welding room without any extra steps since the user only asked where it is.

So, putting it all together, the response will navigate to the Welding Lab at the specified x and y coordinates.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to handle this user's question. The user asked, ""Do you know where the machine shop instructor room is?"" 

First, I need to break down the request and see if it matches any of the predefined waypoints with their keywords. Let me go through each step.

Step 1: Ignore extra tokens. In this case, there are no alphanumeric codes or prefixes at the beginning, so the input remains ""machine shop instructor room.""

Step 2: Keyword Matching. I need to check all the available waypoints and see if any of them have keywords that match parts of the user's query. The waypoints provided include places like the machine shop with keywords [""shop"", ""workshop""], but none seem to mention an ""instructor room."" 

Looking through each waypoint:
- Waypoint names include things like ""Machine Shop"" with keywords like ""shop,"" ""workshop.""
- There's no waypoint named ""Instructor Room"" or anything similar listed in the provided data.

Step 3: Strict Match Requirement. Since none of the waypoints have keywords related to an instructor room, the query doesn't match any available waypoint. 

Therefore, according to the rules, if the input doesn't include any keywords from the available waypoints, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

# Examples
Example Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's question: ""What is the best team if I like racing?"". Let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the waypoints provided, there are a couple related to racing. The ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Concrete Canoe"" both have keywords including ""racing"", but wait, actually checking the data:

Wait, no, let me check again. Scanning through the waypoints, I see that ""Concrete Canoe"" has keywords like ""Concrete"", ""Canoe"". Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering. Wait, looking back at the initial data provided by the user, there's a waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords including ""racing""? Or was it another team?

Wait, no, actually in the given waypoints, under the list after starting location and functions, I see:

- Concrete Canoe: keywords are [""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", ""Design Team""]

And earlier there's a ""Concrete Canoe exists at 1497,691 with same keywords.

Wait, but where does racing come into play? Oh right, under the user prompt section, there's an example where ""racing"" is mentioned in some context. Wait no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me check again.

Looking back: The initial data lists waypoints and their keywords. For example:

- Concrete Canoe exists at 1497,691 with keywords [""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", ""Design Team""].
- Then, under the user's query, they're asking about racing teams.

Wait, but in the provided waypoints, I don't see any that explicitly include ""racing"" as a keyword. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again:

Looking through the waypoint list: 

1. Role section describes various roles and their keywords, but then under the waypoint definitions, each has its own set of keywords.

Wait, actually, looking at the waypoints listed after starting location and functions, there's ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords [""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", ""Design Team""], and another waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe exists at 1497,691. But wait, that might be a duplicate.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that one of the waypoints has ""racing"" as a keyword. Let me check:

Looking back: No, the keywords listed don't include ""racing"". The only mention is under the example prompt where ""C and D areas"" refers to C&D - Coffee Area.

Wait, no, the user's query is about racing teams, so perhaps I need to look for waypoints that have ""racing"" in their name or keywords. But from the data provided, none of the waypoints include ""racing"".

So, when the user asks, ""What is the best team if I like racing?"", the system needs to process this and see if any waypoint matches.

Following the rules, first, ignore extra tokens. The input is ""best team if I like racing"". So after ignoring any possible extra tokens (none here), we look for waypoints that have keywords matching at least one of their defined terms or their name words.

Looking through each waypoint:

- Starting Location: No.
- Available Functions: Not relevant here as the user isn't asking to navigate or speak, but is asking about a team related to racing.
- Waypoints:
  - ""Role"" section describes different teams (like Racing Team), but under the waypoint definitions, I don't see any with ""racing"" in their keywords.

Wait, wait. Let me check again: No, looking at each waypoint:

Looking through all waypoints listed:

1. Starting Location is just a point, not a team.
2. The other waypoints like ""Concrete Canoe"", ""Racing Team""? Wait, no, the list provided by the user doesn't have a waypoint named ""Racing Team"". Let me check.

Wait, in the initial data, after the starting location and functions, the waypoints listed are:

- Role
- ... various waypoints with their names and coordinates, but none explicitly named ""Racing Team"".

Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each one:

Looking at the list, the only mention of racing is under the user's own query, not in the provided waypoints.

So, when the user asks about the best team for racing, the system checks all available waypoints and their keywords. Since none have ""racing"" as a keyword or part of their name, it concludes that no valid waypoint matches the request.

Therefore, according to the rules, if after ignoring extra tokens, the input doesn't include any of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, the response should be an error indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.

So, the system outputs: ""This waypoint does not exist.""
</think>

The user is asking about a racing team, but none of the available waypoints have ""racing"" as a keyword or part of their name. Therefore, the system cannot provide a valid answer.

```json
{
  ""response"": {
    ""text"": ""This waypoint does not exist."",
    ""type"": ""error""
  }
}
```","{'response': {'text': 'This waypoint does not exist.', 'type': 'error'}}",0.0,0.0,"[('speak', 'UWFE')]",Action,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to handle the user's question: ""What is the best team if I like rally racing?"" The user is asking about a team recommendation based on their interest in rally racing. 

First, I need to parse this query and see if it relates to any of the predefined waypoints with their keywords. Let me go through each waypoint one by one.

Looking at the list, there are several teams mentioned: Concrete Canoe, Formula SAE, Hydrogen Hounds, Rally Racers, and Rocket Rides. Each has specific keywords associated with them. 

The user's query includes ""rally racing,"" so I should check which waypoints have keywords that match this. The Rally Racers team has the keyword ""rally"" as part of its keywords. Also, the waypoint name itself is ""Rally Racers,"" so any mention of rally racing would directly relate to this.

I need to apply the rules provided. Step 1 is to ignore extra tokens if any, but in this case, there are none; it's a straightforward question. Then, keyword matching: I look for any keywords or parts of the waypoint name in the user's input. ""Rally racing"" includes ""rally,"" which matches the Rally Racers' keywords.

Next, strict match requirement: The cleaned input must contain at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name. Since ""rally"" is present and uniquely maps to Rally Racers, this is a valid match. No other waypoints have ""rally"" as a keyword, so there's no ambiguity here.

Therefore, the user's question should trigger navigation to the Rally Racers' location. The response will include navigating to that specific waypoint.

I don't see any other actions needed beyond navigation because the query is a straightforward request for information leading to a recommendation.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""

Okay, so the user is asking, ""What is the best team if I like robots?"" First, I need to figure out which of the predefined waypoints matches this question. The keywords for each waypoint are listed, and I should check if any of them relate to robotics or a team that works with robots.

Looking at the waypoints provided: there's no explicit mention of ""robots"" in any of the waypoint names or their associated keywords. The waypoints include teams like ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" ""Ideas Clinic,"" ""Electronics Lab,"" and others, but none are directly related to robotics.

The user is interested in a team that involves robots, so I need to see if any of the existing waypoints might be a good fit despite not being explicitly named. For example, the ""Electronics Lab"" could involve some level of automation or robot-related projects, but it's a stretch since the keywords don't mention robotics.

Alternatively, maybe there's no waypoint that aligns with the user's interest in robots. In that case, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist because none of the available options match the query based on the given keywords and names.

I have to follow the rules strictly: if after cleaning the input (ignoring any extra tokens), the remaining text doesn't include any keywords or parts of the waypoint name for any waypoint, then it's invalid. Since ""robots"" isn't part of any keyword list provided, I can't match this query to an existing waypoint.

Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint they're referring to doesn't exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I've got this user message: ""I like electric skateboards, what design team should I join?"" Hmm, let's break it down. The user is expressing an interest in electric skateboards and is asking which design team they should join. 

First, I need to figure out if there are any keywords or waypoints related to electric skateboards or similar topics. Looking through the provided waypoint list, I see entries like ""Electric Skateboard"" with a specific X and Y coordinate. That's probably relevant here.

The user is asking about design teams, so maybe they're looking for a team that focuses on innovation or transportation. The waypoint ""Electric Skateboard"" seems to fit because it's related to skateboards and likely involves design aspects. 

Wait, I should check if there are other waypoints that might also match. Let me go through the list again. There's a ""Design Team Hub"" with keywords including ""design"", ""hub"". That could be another possibility since the user mentioned ""design team"". 

But according to the rules, I have to ensure that after ignoring extra tokens, the input contains at least one keyword from the waypoint's defined set. The user didn't mention any extra tokens, just a straightforward question about joining a design team related to electric skateboards.

So, considering both ""Electric Skateboard"" and ""Design Team Hub"", but which one is more directly relevant? The user specifically mentioned electric skateboards, so it makes sense to point them towards that team. Plus, the waypoint's keywords include ""skateboard"" and ""electric"", which align perfectly with their interest.

Therefore, I should respond by navigating to the Electric Skateboard design team. If that waypoint doesn't exist or if there's ambiguity, I'd have to inform the user, but in this case, it seems clear.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down this user query step by step. The user says, ""Take me to the Formula Electric Electric Bay."" 

First, I need to understand what they're asking for. It seems like they want to navigate to a specific waypoint called ""Formula Electric Electric Bay."" 

Looking at the list of available waypoints provided, I see one named ""Formula Electric Electric Bay"" with coordinates (100.0, 200.0). The keywords associated with this waypoint include [""formula"", ""electric"", ""bay""]. 

The user's request mentions ""Forumla Electric Electric Bay."" Wait, there's a typo here: ""Forumla"" instead of ""Formula."" But I think it's just a minor spelling mistake and they meant ""Formula Electric Electric Bay."" 

According to the rules, I should ignore extra tokens. So, if the input had something like ""E7 Formula Electric Bay,"" I would strip off the ""E7"" part. In this case, there are no extra tokens beyond the waypoint name itself.

Next, I check if any of the keywords match. The user's cleaned request is ""Formula Electric Electric Bay."" The waypoint's name includes ""formula,"" ""electric,"" and ""bay."" So, the user's request contains all these elements. 

I need to ensure that there isn't another waypoint with overlapping keywords that could cause ambiguity. Scanning through the list, I don't see any other waypoints with similar names or keywords that would match this query. 

Therefore, it's clear that the user is referring to ""Formula Electric Electric Bay."" Since this is a valid waypoint and the keyword matching criteria are satisfied, I can proceed to navigate there without issues.

I also need to make sure that the function requested is supported. The user only used ""navigate,"" which is one of the allowed actions, so no errors here.

So, the response should be a single action: navigating to the specified waypoint with its coordinates.
</think>

To respond to the user's request, we first check if the waypoint exists and matches any keywords. The user requested navigation to ""Formula Electric Electric Bay,"" which is a valid waypoint with coordinates (100.0, 200.0). Since the keyword matching criteria are satisfied and there is no ambiguity, we proceed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down this user prompt. The user says, ""I love Elon Musk and tunnels, what design team shoul I join?"" First, I notice that there are a couple of typos here—'shoul' should be 'should'. But more importantly, the user is expressing interest in joining a design team related to Elon Musk's work with tunnels.

Now, looking at the available waypoints provided, many have keywords associated with them. For instance, there's ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Design Team"" mentioned under two different waypoints: one for Concrete Canoe and another for Ideas Clinic. But wait, in the given data, the Concrete Canoe waypoint has keywords like ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team."" Similarly, the Design Team is also linked to some other waypoints.

The user's question is asking which design team they should join based on their love for Elon Musk and tunnels. Elon Musk is known for projects like The Boring Company, which focuses on tunneling. So, the user might be interested in a design team that relates to tunnel or underground projects.

Looking at the waypoints, ""Concrete Canoe"" has ""design team"" as a keyword, but concrete canoes are more about boat design using concrete. That doesn't directly relate to tunnels. On the other hand, there's an entry under ""Design Team"" which might be linked to a specific project or area within the organization. However, from the given data, it's not explicitly clear if any waypoint is specifically for tunnel design.

The user’s query mentions ""tunnels,"" so ideally, we would look for a waypoint that includes keywords like ""tunnel."" But none of the provided waypoints have that keyword. The closest might be ""Concrete Canoe"" since tunnels often use concrete, but that's a stretch.

So, applying the rules: after ignoring any extra tokens (there aren't any here), the remaining text should contain keywords from at least one waypoint. The user mentions ""design team,"" which is a keyword for both Concrete Canoe and possibly another waypoint like Ideas Clinic or Design Team. But without more specific keywords related to tunnels, it's ambiguous.

Therefore, since there isn't a clear matching waypoint that specifically relates to tunnel design or Elon Musk's projects, the system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }

Okay, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user said, ""Robot, proceed to C&D - Main Entrance and wait for 10 minutes."" 

First, I need to parse the command. The robot is supposed to navigate to a specific location and then wait. But according to the waypoint list provided, there's no ""C&D - Main Entrance"" listed. All the waypoints are things like ""Concrete Canoe,"" ""Role Playing Room,"" etc., but not C&D.

I remember the rules say that if the user includes extra tokens before the actual waypoint name, I should ignore them. So in this case, ""C&D - Main Entrance"" doesn't match any of the available keywords or waypoint names provided. The waypoints don't have anything related to ""C&D,"" so it's not a valid waypoint.

Also, after removing any extra prefixes, the cleaned input still doesn't contain any of the required keywords for existing waypoints. So I can't find a matching waypoint here. 

Since it's an invalid waypoint, according to the instructions, I should respond by telling the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. There's no need to suggest anything else because waiting isn't possible without a valid location.

I think I should output a speak action saying that the waypoint doesn't exist. That makes sense because navigating or waiting isn't feasible if the destination is invalid.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's command. The user said, ""Robot, go to North Entrance and wait for 15 minutes."" 

First, let me parse this command. The robot is being asked to navigate to a location called ""North Entrance"" and then wait for 15 minutes. I should check if ""North Entrance"" is one of the predefined waypoints.

Looking through the list of waypoints provided, I don't see any named ""North Entrance."" There are entries like ""E7 ideas clinic,"" ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" etc., but no North Entrance. 

The rules state that if the cleaned input doesn't match any keywords or the waypoint name's words, it's invalid. Since ""North Entrance"" isn't listed, I have to respond that this waypoint doesn't exist.

I should output an error message using a speak action, indicating that the waypoint is invalid.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's command. The user wrote: ""Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and wait 15 seconds."" 

First, I need to parse the command correctly. The robot is being asked to do two things here: navigate to a specific location and then wait for 15 seconds there. Let me break this down step by step.

Looking at the waypoints provided earlier, I see that one of them is ""C&D - Coffee Area"" with keywords including ""C&D"", ""coffee"", etc. The user mentioned ""C&D - Hot Food Area,"" which seems similar but not exactly matching any existing waypoint in the list. So, I need to check if ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" is a valid waypoint based on the given rules.

The user's instruction says that if the input after ignoring extra tokens doesn't match any keywords of available waypoints, it should respond with an error. In this case, ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" isn't listed among the provided waypoints. The closest one is ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" but that's not the same as hot food.

So, I'm thinking about whether ""C&D"" alone could be enough. According to rule 1, extra tokens like building codes can be ignored. But in this case, ""Hot Food Area"" isn't part of any defined waypoint. The keywords for C&D are more related to coffee or ideas clinic, not food.

Therefore, the robot should recognize that ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" doesn't correspond to any valid waypoint. As a result, it needs to respond with an error message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

Additionally, since the command includes both navigating and waiting, but the first part is invalid, the entire action sequence can't proceed. So, instead of trying to navigate and then wait, the robot should just inform the user about the invalid request.

I don't see any other possible interpretations here because ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" doesn't match any keywords or waypoint names provided in the data. There's no ambiguity; it's clearly not a valid target.

In conclusion, the robot can't navigate to ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" as it's not recognized, so the appropriate response is to inform the user that this waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this problem. The user has instructed the robot to ""go to Temporary Booth and wait for 30 minutes."" My first step is to understand what each part of the command means.

I know that the robot can perform navigate, speak, or wait actions. So, navigating to a location makes sense here. However, I need to check if ""Temporary Booth"" is a valid waypoint based on the provided data.

Looking through the waypoints listed, I don't see any mention of ""Temporary Booth."" The available waypoints include places like E7 - Ideas Clinic and others, but not Temporary Booth. 

According to the rules, after ignoring any extra tokens, if the cleaned input doesn't match any keywords or waypoint names, it's considered invalid. So, since ""Temporary Booth"" isn't listed, the command can't be executed.

Therefore, the appropriate response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist by outputting a speak action with the corresponding message.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, I need to figure out how to handle this user query: ""Robot, proceed to Silent Study and wait for 10 minutes.""

First, let's parse the command. The robot is being asked to navigate to a location called ""Silent Study"" and then wait for 10 minutes.

I'll start by checking if there's any known waypoint named ""Silent Study."" Looking through the provided waypoints, I don't see one listed under the given names. The available ones are things like ""E7 ideas clinic,"" ""ideas clinic,"" ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" and others related to specific competitions or areas.

Next, according to the rules, if the input doesn't match any keywords of known waypoints after ignoring extra tokens, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. So, ""Silent Study"" isn't in the list, and without any matching keywords, it's invalid.

I also need to check if the command includes any supported actions beyond navigate, speak, or wait. In this case, ""wait for 10 minutes"" is a valid action, but since the first part is invalid, I don't proceed further.

Therefore, the response should be an error message indicating that ""Silent Study"" isn't a valid waypoint.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's command. The user wrote, ""Robot, proceed to North Entrance and say 'North Entrance' out loud."" 

First, I'll parse this command step by step. The main parts are: navigate to the North Entrance and then speak the name of that waypoint.

Looking at the waypoints provided, there is a North Entrance defined with coordinates (0.0, 0.0), but wait, that's actually where the robot starts. Hmm, no, let me check again. Wait, the starting location is X:0.0, Y:0.0, and the North Entrance has the same coordinates? That might be an error or perhaps it's intended.

Anyway, moving on. The user wants the robot to navigate to North Entrance. So I'll need to find that waypoint. From the list, yes, there's a North Entrance with X=0.0, Y=0.0. Then, after arriving, say ""North Entrance"" out loud using the speak action.

So the actions will be: first, navigate to North Entrance, then speak the name. Since both are valid and straightforward, I don't expect any issues here.

I should structure the response with two actions in order: navigate followed by speak.
</think>

```json

  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user wrote: ""Robot, navigate to C&D - Hot Food Area and announce 'C&D Hot Food Area' clearly."" 

First, I'll break down the components of the request. The main actions here are navigating and announcing. Let me see if the waypoint they're referring to exists based on the provided waypoints.

Looking at the list, there's a waypoint called ""C&D - Coffee Area"" with coordinates (100, 100). But the user mentioned ""C&D - Hot Food Area."" I don't see that in the given data. The only C&D area listed is the coffee one. 

So, according to the rules, if the waypoint doesn't exist, I need to respond by saying it doesn't exist. Also, since they tried to navigate somewhere invalid, I shouldn't process any actions beyond informing them.

I should ignore extra tokens and check for keyword matches. ""C&D - Hot Food Area"" isn't listed, so there's no match. Therefore, the response should be an error message about the waypoint not existing.
</think>

The user requested navigation to a non-existent waypoint, so we respond with an error message.

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I have this user command: ""Robot, go to Silent Study and say 'Silent Study' in a calm voice."" My job is to figure out how to handle this based on the given rules.

First, I need to check if ""Silent Study"" is an available waypoint. Looking through the list of waypoints provided, I see none named ""Silent Study."" There's ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" various study rooms like ""Silent Reading Room 240,"" but not ""Silent Study.""

Next, I have to process the command step by step. The user is asking the robot to navigate to a specific location and then perform an action (speaking). But since ""Silent Study"" isn't a valid waypoint, the first part of the command fails.

According to the rules, if the waypoint doesn't exist, the response should be an error message. So instead of executing any actions, the robot should inform the user that the waypoint is invalid.

I don't need to consider extra tokens here because ""Silent Study"" is a direct request without any prefixes. Also, there are no keywords associated with ""Silent Study"" in the provided list, so keyword matching doesn't apply.

Since the command includes an unsupported action (navigating to an unknown location), I should only return the error message without attempting any navigation or speaking actions.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command. The user said, ""Robot, move to Assembly Room and state 'Assembly Room' upon arrival.""

First, I'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the waypoint**: The user mentioned ""Assembly Room."" I need to check if this is one of the predefined waypoints. Looking at the list provided, I don't see an ""Assembly Room"" listed. There's a lot of other rooms like Ideas Exchange, C&D - Coffee Area, E7-2150, etc., but no Assembly Room.

2. **Check keywords**: Each waypoint has specific keywords associated with it. Since ""Assembly Room"" isn't in the list, none of the waypoints' keywords or names match this term. Even if I consider possible misspellings or alternative names, there's nothing that fits.

3. **Handle invalid waypoint**: According to the rules, if the cleaned input doesn't include any of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, I should output an error message saying the waypoint doesn't exist.

4. **Construct the response**: The response needs to be a JSON object with an ""speak"" action indicating the error. There's no need to navigate or wait since the command is invalid.

I considered if there might be another name for Assembly Room that I'm missing, but based on the provided data, it doesn't exist. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to the user's request. The user said, ""Take me to the Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want to be taken to a specific location related to the Formula Electric Baja Design Team. Now, looking at the waypoints provided, there's an entry called ""Baja"" with keywords like [""baja"", ""car"", ""design"", ""team""]. There's also another waypoint named ""Concrete Canoe"" which isn't relevant here.

The user mentioned ""Formula Electric Baja Design Team."" I notice that ""Baja"" is part of the name, so that should match one of the waypoints. But wait, in the list, the exact name is just ""Baja,"" not ""Formula Electric Baja."" However, the keywords include ""design team,"" which might be part of what the user is referring to.

I have to consider the rules for keyword matching. The user's input should have at least one keyword or a word from the waypoint's name after ignoring any extra tokens. So, if I remove the extra parts like ""Formula Electric"" and just look for ""Baja Design Team,"" does that match?

Looking at the keywords for the Baja waypoint: [""baja"", ""car"", ""design"", ""team""]. The user's request includes ""Baja"" and ""Design Team."" Both ""baja"" and ""design team"" are part of the keywords, so this should be a valid match.

Wait, but in the waypoints, there are two entries with similar coordinates: Concrete Canoe and Baja both at (1497, 691). But their names and keywords differ. So, the user's request specifically mentions ""Baja,"" which aligns with the waypoint named ""Baja"" with those exact coordinates.

Therefore, I should navigate to the Baja waypoint because it satisfies the keyword criteria. The other possible waypoint is Concrete Canoe, but that doesn't fit here since the user mentioned ""Baja.""

So, my response would be a single action: navigating to the Baja location.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's command. Let me start by breaking down what they're asking.

The user says: ""Robot, proceed to Elevators and say 'Elevators' to assist with navigation.""

First, I should check if ""Elevators"" is a valid waypoint. Looking at the list provided, there are several waypoints, but none of them are named ""Elevators."" There's ""Concrete Canoe,"" ""C&D - Coffee Area,"" etc., but no mention of elevators.

According to the rules, I have to ignore any extra tokens if present, but in this case, the user just mentioned ""Elevators."" Since there's no corresponding waypoint for that, it doesn't match any keywords or names.

I should respond by saying that the waypoint doesn't exist. The error message specified is: ""This waypoint does not exist.""

So, my response will be a speak action with that message.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,[],,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's request: ""Can you take me to the UWFE bay please."" First, I'll break down the query according to the guidelines provided.

The starting location is (0.0, 0.0). The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. 

Looking at the waypoints listed, I see that there's one named ""UWFE Bay"" with keywords including ""bay."" The user mentioned ""UWFE bay,"" which seems to match exactly with the waypoint name.

I should check if any extra tokens need to be ignored. In this case, ""UWFE"" is part of the waypoint's name, so it doesn't count as an extra token that needs ignoring. 

Next, I'll apply keyword matching. The waypoint has keywords [""bay""] and its own name includes ""UWFE."" The user's input after cleaning (removing any possible extra tokens) is ""UWFE bay,"" which includes both the waypoint's name and a keyword.

Since this matches clearly with only one waypoint, there's no ambiguity. Therefore, I can proceed to navigate to that location.

I need to structure the response as an array of actions. The action here is to navigate, using the waypoint's name, x, and y coordinates. 

So, the response will be a single navigate action pointing to ""UWFE Bay"" with its specific coordinates.
</think>

To handle the user's request to go to the UWFE bay, we first check if the requested waypoint exists in the list.

The cleaned input after ignoring any extra tokens is ""uwfe bay"". This matches exactly with the waypoint named ""UWFE Bay"", which has keywords that include ""bay"".

Since this is a valid and unambiguous match, the response will be:

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""navigate"",
      ""input"": {
        ""name"": ""UWFE Bay"",
        ""x"": 420.36,
        ""y"": -57.18

    }

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking. They said, ""Can you take me to the WFE bay please."" My first step is to figure out which waypoint this refers to.

Looking at the list of waypoints provided, I need to match ""WFE bay"" with one of them. The user might be referring to a specific location related to WFE (which could stand for something like Waterways or Environmental Engineering). Scanning through the waypoints, I see ""Concrete Canoe"" under section 1004 and ""WFE Bay"" isn't directly listed.

Wait, no, actually in the list provided, there's a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" but that doesn't include WFE. Let me double-check the waypoints again. Oh, wait, I see ""Concrete Canoe"" under section 1004 with keywords like Concrete and Canoe. There's also another waypoint: ""WFE Bay"" isn't listed here.

Wait a minute, looking back at the list, the user mentioned ""WFE bay"", but in our waypoints, there isn't an exact match for that. The closest might be if WFE is part of the name or keywords, but from what's provided, I don't see it. So, maybe the user made a typo or refers to something not listed.

Alternatively, perhaps ""WFE"" stands for something else and the correct waypoint isn't present in our database. Since none of the waypoints have ""WFE"" as part of their keywords or names, except if I'm missing something. Let me check again: nope, none match ""WFE bay"".

So, according to the rules, if after ignoring extra tokens (which in this case, there are none), the remaining input doesn't contain any keywords from any waypoint, it's invalid. Therefore, the system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

I think I've covered all possible matches and confirmed that ""WFE bay"" isn't present. So the response should be an error message stating the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this user's request. They're asking to be taken to the ""FE bay"". I need to figure out which waypoint this corresponds to.

First, I'll look at the waypoints listed. The available ones include places like ""FE Bay"" and others related to different projects or areas. The keywords for each are provided, so I should check if ""FE bay"" matches any of these.

The ""FE Bay"" waypoint has keywords: [""FE"", ""bay""]. The user's input is ""FE bay"", which exactly matches the keywords without any extra tokens. So it seems like a direct match.

I also need to make sure there are no other waypoints that might have overlapping keywords. Looking through the list, none of the others seem to share both ""FE"" and ""bay"". 

Since it's a clear match, I can proceed with navigating to this waypoint. There's no ambiguity here, so I don't need to worry about multiple possibilities.

Therefore, the response should be a single navigate action to the FE Bay.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request: ""Can you take me to the Formula bay please."" Let's break this down step by step.

First, the starting location is (0.0, 0.0), but that doesn't matter here because we're just navigating to another waypoint.

Looking at the available waypoints provided earlier, I need to check if ""Formula bay"" matches any of them. The user might be referring to a specific area related to Formula racing or a similar context.

I'll go through each waypoint and see if it includes keywords that match ""Formula"" or ""bay."" From the list:

- Formula Bay is listed with keywords including ""formula,"" so this seems like a direct match.

The rules say I should ignore extra tokens, but here there are no extra tokens. The user's request directly points to ""Formula bay,"" which matches the waypoint name exactly except for case differences (bay vs. Bay), but that shouldn't matter since it's the same word.

I don't see any other waypoints with similar keywords or names related to Formula or bay, so this should be a clear match without ambiguity.

Therefore, I can confidently navigate to ""Formula Bay."" Since there are no extra steps or actions needed beyond navigation, the response will just include the navigate action.
</think>

To respond to the request ""Can you take me to the Formula bay please,"" we need to determine if ""Formula bay"" matches any of the available waypoints. Looking at the list of waypoints provided:

- **Waypoint**: Formula Bay
  - Keywords: [""formula"", ""bay""]
  
The input ""Formula bay"" matches exactly with the waypoint name ""Formula Bay."" After ignoring extra tokens (if any), we see that it clearly points to the ""Formula Bay"" waypoint without ambiguity. Therefore, this is a valid request.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user is asking, ""Can you take me to the Mars Rover bay?"" 

First, I need to understand what they're looking for. They want to go to a specific location: the Mars Rover bay. So my goal is to determine if this destination exists based on the provided waypoints.

Looking at the list of available waypoints, I don't see any that mention ""Mars Rover"" or ""rover."" The waypoints listed include places like E7 ideas clinic, C&D areas, RoboHub, and others, but none related to a Mars Rover. 

Next, I should check if there are any keywords or waypoint names that might be a match by mistake. For example, maybe one of the existing waypoints has ""rover"" as a keyword, but in this case, none do. The closest is ""Mars"" but not ""Rover."" 

Since the user's destination isn't listed, and after ignoring any extra tokens (there are none here), it's clear that ""Mars Rover bay"" doesn't correspond to any of the provided waypoints. 

Therefore, according to the rules, I should respond by telling them that the waypoint doesn't exist. The system is set up to output a specific error message when a waypoint isn't found.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's try to figure out how to respond to this user's query. The user asked, ""Can you take me to a car design team?"" My goal is to determine if there's a matching waypoint based on the keywords provided.

First, I'll break down the request. The user wants to go to a ""car design team."" So I'm looking for any waypoints that include either the exact words or keywords related to this phrase.

Looking at the list of waypoints, I see two that might be relevant: ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Concrete Canoe 2."" Their keywords are ""concrete,"" ""canoe,"" and ""design team."" Wait, no, actually, checking again, both have ""design team"" as part of their keywords. So if the user mentions a design team, this could match.

Wait, but ""car design team"" specifically. Let me look through all waypoints to see if any mention cars or automotive design. Scanning through, I don't see any waypoints with ""car,"" ""automobile,"" or related terms in their names or keywords. The closest is the design teams for Concrete Canoe and maybe others, but those are not car-related.

So when the user says ""car design team,"" there's no matching waypoint. Therefore, according to the rules, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.
</think>

The user's request to go to a ""car design team"" does not match any available waypoints since none of them have keywords related to cars or automotive design.

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Parse Request:** The user wants to navigate to a ""car design team.""
2. **Check Waypoints:** No waypoint has ""car,"" ""automobile,"" or similar in its name or keywords.
3. **Determine Response:** Since no matching waypoint exists, respond with an error message.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
```","{'actions': [{'action': 'speak', 'input': 'This waypoint does not exist'}]}",0.0,0.0,"[['UWFE - Mech Bay','UWFE - Electrical Bay','UWAFT - Workbay','UWAFT - Office','Baja','Midnight Sun']]",Nav,
"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Okay, let's break down this user query. The user is asking to be taken to the ""car design team."" First, I need to figure out which waypoint this refers to from the given list.

Looking at the waypoints, there are a few that mention a design team. Specifically, Concrete Canoe, Car Design Team, and others have keywords like ""design team"" or similar terms.

Wait, but in the provided waypoints, I see entries like ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords including ""Design Team."" So when the user mentions ""car design team,"" it's likely referring to a specific waypoint associated with car design. However, checking the list again, I don't see an explicit waypoint named ""Car Design Team.""

Hmm, maybe there's a waypoint that includes both ""car"" and ""design team."" Let me check each one:

- Concrete Canoe has keywords including ""Concrete,"" ""Canoe,"" and ""Design Team.""
- Car Design Team is another entry with the same keywords.

Wait, perhaps I missed it. The user mentioned ""car design team,"" so I should look for a waypoint that includes both ""car"" and ""design team."" If such a waypoint exists, then it's the correct match.

Assuming there is a ""Car Design Team"" waypoint in the list with keywords like ""car,"" ""design,"" and ""team,"" then the user's query would match. The system would navigate to that specific location.

But if no such waypoint exists, the response should indicate that the waypoint doesn't exist. Since I don't see an explicit one in the provided data, but there are others with similar keywords, maybe it's ambiguous or invalid.

Wait, looking again, the user query is ""car design team."" The system ignores extra tokens and matches against the waypoints' keywords. If any waypoint includes ""design"" or ""team,"" it might match multiple points, leading to ambiguity.

Therefore, without a clear single waypoint matching both ""car"" and ""design team,"" the system would respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: ""Take me to the washroom."" Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at all the available waypoints provided. Each has a name and associated keywords. The goal is to see if any of these match the user's request after applying the rules given.

The user said ""washroom,"" which is pretty direct. I should check each waypoint's keywords to see if there's a match. Looking through the list, I don't see any waypoints with ""washroom"" in their name or keywords. The closest might be something like ""Concrete Canoe"" or ""E7 Ideas Clinic,"" but neither of those relate to washrooms.

According to rule 1, I should ignore extra tokens if present. In this case, the user didn't include any extra tokens; it's just ""washroom."" Rule 2 says that a valid reference must include at least one keyword or part of the waypoint name. Since none of the waypoints have ""washroom"" as a keyword or in their name, there's no match.

Rule 3 states that if after cleaning up the input, there are no matching keywords and it doesn't clearly point to one waypoint, it's invalid. Here, ""washroom"" doesn't align with any provided waypoints, so it's definitely invalid.

Since there's no matching waypoint, I should respond by telling the user that the waypoint doesn't exist. The response needs to be an action array with a speak command saying exactly that.

I also need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe ""washroom"" is part of another waypoint's name or keywords? Scanning through again—nope, none of them have that. So it's safe to conclude that the user is asking for a non-existent waypoint.

Therefore, the correct response is to output an error message stating the waypoint doesn't exist.
</think>

The user requested navigation to ""the washroom,"" which does not correspond to any available waypoints based on their names or keywords. Therefore, the system should respond with an error indicating that the waypoint does not exist.

```json

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond when the user says, ""Take me to the bathroom."" Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll refer back to the provided waypoints. The available locations include various clubs and specific points like E7 ideas clinic, C&D coffee area, and others, but I don't see any waypoint named ""bathroom"" or related terms. 

The user's command is straightforward: they want to go to the bathroom. Since none of the listed waypoints match this request, I need to handle it as an invalid command.

Looking at the rules, if the cleaned input doesn't match any keywords or waypoint names, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist. So, in this case, the response is clear—inform the user that the bathroom isn't a valid waypoint.

I don't need to execute any navigation since there's no matching location. Instead, I'll just speak an error message.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

# Examples
Example Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?

Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query: ""Take me to the Formula Electric Waterloop design team."" The goal is to determine if there's a valid waypoint that matches this request based on the given keywords and waypoints.

First, I'll start by parsing the user's input. The user mentioned ""Formula Electric Waterloop design team."" So, breaking it down, the key terms here are ""Formula,"" ""Electric,"" ""Waterloop,"" and ""design team.""

Looking at the list of available waypoints provided, I need to check which ones have keywords related to these terms. Let me go through each waypoint one by one.

1. **Waypoint: Formula Electric**
   - Keywords: Formula, electric
   - The user's input includes both ""Formula"" and ""Electric,"" so this seems like a strong match. However, the user also mentioned ""Waterloop,"" which isn't part of this waypoint's keywords. But since the main focus is on Formula and Electric, maybe that's sufficient.

2. **Waypoint: Waterloop**
   - Keywords: waterloop
   - The user specifically mentioned ""Waterloop,"" so this is another potential match. However, it doesn't include any terms related to Formula or Electric.

3. **Waypoint: Design Team**
   - I don't see a waypoint named exactly like that. There are other waypoints with ""design team"" as part of their names, but in the list provided, each design team seems to be tied to specific projects, like Formula Electric and others.

Wait, looking again at the list, actually, there's no explicit ""Design Team"" waypoint. The design teams seem to be part of specific project waypoints, such as Formula Electric having its own with keywords including ""design team."" Let me check that.

Looking back, the user's input includes ""design team,"" so I need to see if any waypoint has this in their keywords. For example:

- **Waypoint: Formula Electric** has keywords like [""formula"", ""electric"", ""car"", ""competition"", ""lab""], which doesn't include ""design team.""
- Other waypoints might have ""design"" as a keyword, but not necessarily ""design team.""

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan the list again.

Ah, looking through the provided waypoints, I see that each design team is part of specific projects like Formula Electric, RoboHub, etc., but none are explicitly named ""Design Team."" So, perhaps the user's request is a bit ambiguous because it combines ""Formula Electric"" with ""Waterloop Design Team,"" which might not map directly to any single waypoint.

But wait, in the initial list, there's a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" and another called ""Concrete Canoe (design team)."" Similarly, other design teams have their own waypoints. However, for Formula Electric, it's just ""Formula Electric"" with specific keywords.

So, when the user says ""Forumla Electric Waterloop design team,"" they're combining two concepts: Formula Electric and Waterloop Design Team. But in the provided list, there isn't a waypoint that combines both. Instead, each is separate.

Therefore, the closest match would be either ""Formula Electric"" or ""Waterloop."" Since the user mentioned both, but no single waypoint covers both, the request is ambiguous. According to the rules, if multiple waypoints could be inferred without a clear winner, it's considered invalid.

Alternatively, maybe ""Formula Electric"" includes design team as part of its keywords? Let me check again. No, the keywords for Formula Electric are [""formula"", ""electric""], not including ""design"" or ""team."" So, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider if any waypoint has both ""formula"" and ""waterloop"" in their keywords. Looking through all the waypoints, none do. Each is separate: Formula Electric, Waterloop, etc., but no combined one.

So, the user's request includes terms from two different waypoints. Therefore, without a clear single match, it's invalid. The system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist because there's no exact match covering both ""Formula Electric"" and ""Waterloop Design Team.""

Thus, the response would be to speak an error message indicating the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle the user's request to be taken to the restroom. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, the user said, ""Take me to the restroom."" My goal is to determine if this matches any of the predefined waypoints based on their keywords and names. 

Looking at the list of available waypoints, I see several restrooms or related facilities. For example, there's a waypoint named ""E7 - Ideas Clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], but that's more about a clinic than a restroom. Then there are entries like ""Concrete Canoe"" and ""Concrete Canoe 2"" which don't seem relevant here.

Wait, I should check all the waypoints again. Let me go through each one:

- E7 Ideas Clinic: keywords include ""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room"". The user mentioned ""restroom"", so this doesn't fit.
- C&D - Coffee Area: keywords are ""c"", ""d"", ""coffee"", ""area"". Not related to restrooms.
- Atrium: keywords are ""atrium"", ""common"", ""area"". Also not relevant.
- Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic: same as E7, so no match.
- Room 3058: just a number and generic. Doesn't specify a restroom.
- Mechanical Room: related to facilities but not a user restroom.
- Storage Closet A: also a storage area, not a restroom.

Hmm, I'm noticing that none of the waypoints explicitly mention ""restroom"", ""bathroom"", or any synonyms. The closest might be the ""E7 - Ideas Clinic"" if it's a clinic with restrooms nearby, but according to the waypoint data, the keywords don't include anything related to restrooms.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check all waypoints again:

Looking through each entry, I see that none have ""restroom"" or similar terms in their names or keywords. The only possible exception might be if a waypoint's name or keywords indirectly imply a restroom, but based on the given data, there's no such match.

Therefore, since after ignoring any extra tokens (in this case, just ""restroom""), the input doesn't contain any of the keywords or part of the names of the available waypoints related to restrooms, the request is invalid. 

So, I need to respond by saying that the waypoint does not exist and provide an error message accordingly.

  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this user request step by step. The user is asking me to navigate through several waypoints in a specific order and then perform some actions. First, I need to understand each part of the command.

The user starts with ""Go to the Formula Electric Electrical bay..."" Looking at the available waypoints, I see there's one named ""Formula Electric Electrical Bay"" with keywords like [""formula"", ""electric"", ""electrical"", ""bay""]. The cleaned input after removing extra tokens is ""formula electric electrical bay"". This matches because it contains ""formula"" and ""electric"", which are part of the waypoint's keywords. So, I can navigate to that location.

Next, they mention ""then the Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Checking the waypoints, there's a ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" with keywords like [""formula"", ""electric"", ""mech"", ""bay""]. The cleaned command includes ""formula electric mech bay"", which again matches because it contains all relevant terms. I'll add this navigate action.

Then, the user says ""then the Baja..."" Looking through the waypoints provided, there's no entry for ""Baja"". Wait a minute, maybe I missed something? Let me check the list again... Nope, no waypoint named ""Baja"" is listed. That might be an issue because without that data, I can't proceed.

Moving on, the command continues: ""...then to Rocketry..."" There's a waypoint called ""Rocketry"" with keywords like [""rocketry""]. The cleaned input includes ""rocketry"", so that's clear. But since the previous step had an issue, the whole plan might be affected.

Next is ""Midnight Sun."" I don't see any waypoint named ""Midnight Sun"" in the list either. So, both ""Baja"" and ""Midnight Sun"" are invalid waypoints. This means after navigating to Rocketry, I can't proceed further because the next steps reference non-existent locations.

After that, the user wants me to wait 5 minutes. But since some of the previous steps are invalid, I need to handle this carefully. According to the rules, if any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, I should output an error message.

So, putting it all together: The first two waypoints exist and can be navigated to, but the third (""Baja"") is invalid. Since the user's command includes multiple steps after that (Rocketry and Midnight Sun), which are also invalid, the entire request is flawed. Therefore, I should respond with an error message indicating that ""Midnight Sun"" doesn't exist, as it's the last invalid waypoint mentioned.

I'll structure the response to include a speak action informing the user of the invalid waypoint.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]

Alright, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user is asking to go through several waypoints and then do some actions after.

First, I need to parse the command step by step. The starting point is (0,0), but the first destination is ""Formula Electric Electrical bay."" Looking at the waypoints provided, there's one called ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" with keywords including ""formula electric,"" ""bay,"" and others. However, ""Electric Electrical bay"" isn't listed as a waypoint. So, this might be an invalid reference.

Wait, maybe I should check if any waypoint has ""formula electric"" in its keywords or name. Yes, the ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" does include ""formula electric."" But the user mentioned ""Electrical bay,"" which isn't exactly matching any keyword. So, perhaps that's an invalid waypoint.

Next, after that, they want to go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, which is a valid waypoint. Then Baja, which exists. Midnight Sun is another point I need to check. Looking through the waypoints, there's no ""Midnight Sun"" listed. That could be another issue.

So, breaking it down: The first step is invalid because ""Formula Electric Electrical bay"" doesn't match any keywords or names of the available waypoints. Since this is the first waypoint, if it's invalid, the whole command can't be processed. Therefore, I should respond with an error that the waypoint doesn't exist.

I think that's the correct approach because according to the rules, each step must reference a valid waypoint correctly. If any part of the command refers to an invalid waypoint, the entire action is invalid.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to process this user's request. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user says: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja.""

Wait, that seems a bit off. I notice a typo where they wrote ""the to"" instead of ""then."" So it should probably be ""go to Formula Electric Mech Bay, then go to Baja, then go to Rocketry, then go to Midnight Sun. Then wait 5 minutes, then back to baja.""

Alright, let's process each part.

1. The first destination is the Formula Electric Mech Bay. Looking at the waypoints provided, there's a waypoint called ""Formula Electric - Mech Bay."" So that's straightforward. I'll navigate there.

2. Next, go to Baja. There's a waypoint named ""Baja"" with coordinates (x=500, y=400). That's clear.

3. Then Rocketry. Checking the waypoints, there's a ""Rocketry"" at (100, 500).

4. Next is Midnight Sun. Hmm, looking through the list provided, I don't see any waypoint named ""Midnight Sun."" The available waypoints include things like C&D - Coffee Area, E7 - Ideas Clinic, Formula Electric - Mech Bay, Baja, Rocketry, etc., but no Midnight Sun. So this part of the command is invalid.

5. After that, wait 5 minutes. That's a valid action, so I can add a ""wait"" action with input 300 (since 5 minutes is 300 seconds). But since the previous step was invalid, maybe I should handle it earlier.

6. Finally, back to Baja. So from wherever they end up after Midnight Sun, but since Midnight Sun isn't valid, perhaps the entire command after that is affected.

Wait, according to the rules, if any part of the command references an invalid waypoint, we need to respond with an error message. In this case, ""Midnight Sun"" doesn't exist. So I should output the error: ""This waypoint does not exist.""

Additionally, the user included a wait and then returning to Baja after that, but since the earlier step is invalid, I don't process those actions.

So, my response will be a speak action indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.""

First, I'll parse each part of the command. The starting point is (0,0). The first destination is ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Looking at the waypoints, there's one named ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" with keywords like ""formula,"" ""electric,"" ""mech,"" and ""bay."" So that should match.

Next, after Formula Electric Mech Bay, the user says ""then the Baja."" I'll check for a waypoint named ""Baja."" There is one listed with keywords including ""baja."" So that's clear.

Then the command has ""the to Rocketry."" The word ""Rocketry"" isn't in any of the waypoints. Checking all the waypoints, none have ""rocketry"" as part of their name or keywords. So this part doesn't match any existing waypoint.

Next is ""Midnight Sun,"" but again, looking through the list, there's no waypoint with that name or related keywords. 

Since Rocketry and Midnight Sun aren't valid waypoints, I can't process those parts. The user also mentioned waiting 5 minutes after Midnight Sun, but since that location isn't valid, the wait action can't be executed.

So, my response should navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay and then Baja, as they are valid. For Rocketry and Midnight Sun, since they don't exist, I need to inform the user about the invalid waypoints. However, according to the rules, if any part of the command is invalid after a valid action, the entire command might be considered invalid. But in this case, I can still process the first two valid steps and then inform them about the others.

Wait, no, looking back at the instructions: when processing multiple steps, each must be valid. Since Rocketry and Midnight Sun are invalid, I should output an error for those but also note that part of the command is valid. But according to the rules, if any waypoint doesn't match, the response should indicate that it doesn't exist. So perhaps after navigating to Baja, I need to inform them about the next waypoints not existing.

Alternatively, maybe process as much as possible and then report the error for the invalid parts. Or perhaps since the entire command includes multiple steps with some invalid, the whole thing is invalid beyond the first two steps.

But in the examples provided, when part of a command is invalid, the response points out that it doesn't exist. So I think it's better to process the valid parts and then inform them about the invalid ones.

Wait, but according to the rules: if the input after cleaning doesn't match any waypoint keywords or names for any waypoint, output an error. But here, each step is a separate waypoint reference. So ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" is valid, then ""Baja"" is valid, then ""Rocketry"" and ""Midnight Sun"" are invalid.

So I think the correct approach is to process the first two steps (navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay, then Baja), and for the remaining steps, output an error since those waypoints don't exist. But in terms of actions, perhaps the robot should only perform up to the valid points before stopping.

Wait, but the user wants a single response. So if the command includes multiple steps with some invalid, do I handle each step individually? Or is it that the entire command must be valid?

Looking back at the rules: For multi-step commands, list actions in order. If any waypoint doesn't match, output an error for that part. But since the user's request has four waypoints, two of which are invalid, maybe after processing the first two, I should return an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire command is considered invalid because it includes non-existent waypoints beyond the first two. However, in the examples given, if a single step is invalid, the response is an error. So maybe each step needs to be valid on its own.

Wait, but the user's instruction is: ""Go to A, then B, then C."" If A and B are valid, but C isn't, do I process A and B, or just return an error because C doesn't exist?

I think according to the rules, each step must be a valid waypoint. So if any part of the command is invalid, the entire instruction might be considered invalid. However, in this case, since two steps are valid, but the next ones aren't, perhaps I should process up to the last valid step and then inform them about the invalid parts.

Alternatively, maybe the robot stops at the first invalid waypoint and outputs an error message. For example:

1. Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay.
2. Then navigate to Baja.
3. Attempting to go to Rocketry (invalid), so output error.

But in terms of a single response, perhaps I should list all actions and note where it fails. But the rules say that if any waypoint doesn't match, output an error for that part. So perhaps after navigating to Baja, I inform them about Rocketry not existing.

Wait, but looking back at the user's instruction: ""Go to A, then B, then C, then D."" Each is a separate step. So the robot should process each in order, and if any step fails, it stops and reports the error for that specific step.

So first, navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay (valid). Then from there, navigate to Baja (valid). Next, attempt to go to Rocketry (invalid), so output an error about Rocketry not existing. Since the wait is after Midnight Sun, which is also invalid, perhaps the error message should include all invalid steps.

Alternatively, maybe the robot processes each step sequentially and reports errors as they come.

In this case, I think it's best to process the valid steps first and then inform the user about the invalid ones. So:

- Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay.
- Then navigate to Baja.
- Attempting Rocketry: invalid, so output error.
- The wait is after Midnight Sun, which is also invalid.

So in the response, I should include the two valid navigations and then an error message about the remaining steps not existing. However, since the user's instruction is a single command with multiple steps, perhaps the correct approach is to process each step individually and report any errors as they occur.

Wait, but in the given example by the user, the response was only for the first valid step and then an error. So maybe after processing Formula Electric Mech Bay and Baja, I output that Rocketry and Midnight Sun don't exist.

Alternatively, perhaps since Rocketry and Midnight Sun are invalid, the entire command beyond the first two steps is invalid, so I process up to the last valid step (Baja) and then inform them about the other parts being invalid.

I think in this case, the best approach is to navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay and Baja as they are valid, and then output an error message indicating that Rocketry and Midnight Sun don't exist. So I'll include both valid actions first and then the error.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Parse the Command:** The user instructs to navigate through four waypoints in sequence.
2. **First Waypoint - Formula Electric Mech Bay:** Valid, as it matches an existing waypoint.
3. **Second Waypoint - Baja:** Also valid, another existing waypoint.
4. **Third Waypoint - Rocketry:** Invalid, no matching waypoint exists.
5. **Fourth Waypoint - Midnight Sun:** Invalid, no matching waypoint exists.
6. **Wait Command:** Cannot be executed as the preceding waypoints are invalid.

**Response:**
- Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay (valid).
- Then navigate to Baja (valid).
- Inform the user that Rocketry and Midnight Sun do not exist.

**Answer:**

The robot will first navigate from the starting point (0,0) to the ""Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Upon arrival, it will then proceed to the next destination, which is the ""Baja"" waypoint. However, when attempting to move to ""Rocketry,"" the robot recognizes that this waypoint does not exist in the provided list. Similarly, ""Midnight Sun"" is also an invalid waypoint.

**Final Answer:**

The robot successfully navigates to the Formula Electric Mech Bay and then to Baja. The subsequent waypoints Rocketry and Midnight Sun do not exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's try to figure out how to handle this user request. The user wants me to go through several waypoints: Formula Electric Mech Bay, then Baja, then Rocketry, and finally Midnight Sun.

First, I'll start by parsing each part of the command. The user mentioned ""Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay."" Looking at the waypoints provided, there's one named ""Formula Electric Mech Bay"" with keywords including ""formula,"" ""electric,"" ""mech bay,"" etc. So that should match without a problem.

Next up is ""Baja."" From the list, I see a waypoint called ""Baja"" with keywords like ""baja"" and ""design team."" Since the user just mentioned ""Baja,"" it should directly match that waypoint.

Then, the user said ""then the to Rocketry."" Wait, that seems a bit off. It looks like there might be a typo here because of the double ""the."" I'll ignore the extra tokens as per the rules and focus on ""Rocketry."" Looking at the waypoints provided, I don't see any named ""Rocketry"" or with keywords related to rocketry. The closest is Rocketry mentioned in some waypoint? Hmm, checking back, no, the list doesn't include a ""Rocketry"" waypoint. So this part of the command doesn't match any existing waypoint.

Finally, the user added ""then to Midnight Sun."" Again, looking at the provided waypoints, there's no ""Midnight Sun"" listed either. So that doesn't match anything.

Since Rocketry and Midnight Sun aren't valid waypoints, I can only process up to Baja. After reaching Baja, I should inform the user about the missing waypoints so they know the rest of the command couldn't be executed.
</think>

The user has requested a series of navigation steps but some destinations are invalid. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Navigate to Formula Electric Mech Bay**: This is valid as per the waypoint list.

2. **Navigate to Baja**: Also valid.

3. **Rocketry and Midnight Sun**: These do not exist in the provided waypoints, so an error message is returned after processing the valid steps.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, I need to figure out how to handle the user's command: ""Go to Baja and tell them to give Zach his powerdrill back."" 

First, I'll break down the components of the command. The main parts are navigating to a location called Baja and then performing an action there.

Looking at the waypoints provided, I see one named ""Baja"" with coordinates X=0, Y=0. Wait, no, actually, checking again, the starting location is (0,0), but the waypoint for Baja isn't listed in the given data. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check the list again.

Wait, the user provided a list of waypoints, including ""Baja"". Yes, under the waypoints, there's an entry: ""- Men's Washroom..."" but no, actually, looking back, the Baja waypoint is listed as one of them. Wait, perhaps I need to double-check.

No, looking at the initial data, the user listed several waypoints with their coordinates and keywords, including ""Baja"" with X=0, Y=0. So yes, it's a valid waypoint.

So, the first step is to navigate to Baja. That's straightforward since it's one of the defined waypoints.

Next part: ""tell them to give Zach his powerdrill back."" This seems like a speak action after arriving at Baja. But I have to see if the system allows for such interactions. The supported functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So, yes, using 'speak' is valid here.

I need to structure the response as an array of actions. First, navigate to Baja, then speak the message. 

Wait, but the user's command says ""tell them..."", so perhaps the robot should first go there, then speak the message upon arrival. So two separate actions: navigate and then speak after arriving.

I don't see any ambiguity here because Baja is a single, clear waypoint. The keywords for Baja include ""baja"", so the command matches exactly.

No extra tokens to ignore since ""Baja"" is just the name. 

So the response should be an array with two actions: navigate to Baja and then speak the message.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let's break down this user request: ""Go to Rocketry wait for 5 minutes."" 

First, I need to identify if ""Rocketry"" is a valid waypoint. Looking at the provided waypoints, I don't see any named ""Rocketry"" or with keywords related to rocketry. So, it doesn't match any available waypoints.

Next, according to the rules, since ""Rocketry"" isn't recognized, the system should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist and not proceed further. The user's command also includes a wait action, but since the initial navigation is invalid, all subsequent actions are irrelevant.

I should generate an error message indicating that ""Rocketry"" isn't a valid waypoint. No navigation or waiting actions can be executed if the starting point is invalid.
</think>

```json
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for. The command is ""Go to the wash bay and tell them to get out."" So, I need to figure out if this matches any of the predefined waypoints.

First, I'll process the first part: ""go to the wash bay."" Looking at the list of waypoints, I see one named ""Wash Bay"" with keywords including ""wash"" and ""bay."" The user's command includes both these words, so it clearly points to the Wash Bay waypoint. That seems straightforward.

Next, the second part is ""tell them to get out."" This is a bit tricky because it involves communication. However, in the given context, the available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So, after navigating to the wash bay, I can use the speak function to convey the message.

I should check if there's any ambiguity here. Since ""wash bay"" uniquely matches the Wash Bay waypoint without any overlap with other waypoints' keywords or names, it's a clear match. There's no need for further clarification.

So, the plan is to first navigate to the wash bay using the navigate function and then speak the message to tell them to get out. I don't see any invalid actions here since everything fits within the supported functions.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...

Okay, so I've got this user query: ""Go to the open area and tell them to clean up."" Hmm. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting point is X=0.0, Y=0.0. The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. The user wants me to go somewhere and then do something else.

The first part of the command is ""Go to the open area."" I need to figure out if there's a waypoint that matches this. Looking at the list, none of the waypoints have ""open area"" as their name or keywords. Waypoints like E7 Ideas Clinic, C&D Coffee Area, etc., but nothing called Open Area.

Wait, maybe ""open area"" is part of one of the waypoints? Let me check each waypoint's name and keywords. For example, Concrete Canoe has keywords Concrete and Canoe. The C&D area has keywords C, D, Coffee, etc. I don't see any that match ""open area."" So, navigating to an open area isn't a valid waypoint.

Since the first part is invalid, I can't proceed further. The system should respond with an error because it doesn't recognize ""open area"" as a valid waypoint.

So, the response would be: ""This waypoint does not exist."" And that's all because there's no point in trying to do anything else if the initial navigation fails.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I need to figure out how to handle this user's request: ""Take me to the Formula Electric WARG design team."" Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the available waypoints and their keywords. The user mentioned ""Formula Electric"" which is also known as FE, but looking through the waypoints provided, I don't see any that directly match ""Formula Electric"" or ""WARG"". However, there are a few related to design teams: Concrete Canoe, Formula Electric, and WARG.

Wait, no, let me check again. The waypoints listed include:

- Concrete Canoe with keywords like Concrete, Canoe, Design Team.
- Formula Electric (if it's in the list) would have its own set of keywords, but I don't see it here. Hmm, actually looking at the provided data, there is a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords including Design Team, but no explicit mention of Formula Electric or WARG.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each waypoint:

1. **Formula Electric**: Not listed in the waypoints provided.
2. **WARG**: Also not listed as a separate waypoint.
3. **Concrete Canoe**: Yes, this is there with keywords including Concrete, Canoe, Design Team.

So when the user says ""Formula Electric WARG design team"", I need to see if any of the available waypoints match these terms.

The keywords for each waypoint are:

- Concrete Canoe: [""Concrete"", ""Canoe"", ""Design"", ""Team""]
- Formula Electric: Not present in the given data.
- WARG: Not present as a separate waypoint either.

So when processing the user's request, I first ignore any extra tokens. The cleaned input is ""Formula Electric WARG design team"". Now, I need to check each waypoint to see if their keywords or name parts are included.

Looking at ""Concrete Canoe"", does it have any of these terms? No, unless ""Design Team"" is part of its keywords. Since ""design team"" is part of the Concrete Canoe's keywords, maybe that could be a match. But wait, the user specifically mentioned Formula Electric and WARG, which aren't linked to Concrete Canoe.

Wait, but in the waypoint list, there's also a ""Formula Electric"" waypoint? Let me check again. No, according to the data provided, there isn't one. Only ""Concrete Canoe"", ""WARG"" isn't present either.

Therefore, none of the available waypoints have keywords that match ""Formula Electric"", ""WARG"", or ""design team"". The closest is ""Concrete Canoe"" with ""Design Team"", but without more specific terms like Formula Electric, it doesn't fit.

Since there's no exact keyword match for any part of the user's request, I can't identify a valid waypoint. So according to the rules, I should respond that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I've got this user query: ""Go to the paint room and tell them to clean up."" Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to figure out where ""paint room"" refers to. Looking at the waypoints provided, none of them are explicitly called ""paint room."" Hmm, that might be a problem. Maybe there's a keyword related to cleaning or paint in one of the existing waypoints?

Let me check each waypoint's keywords. The ""Paint Room"" isn't listed, but I see several other rooms with different purposes. Wait, is there any chance that ""paint"" is part of another room's name? Scanning through, no, it doesn't seem like it.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a general area for cleaning or maintenance. But looking at the waypoints, none have keywords related to painting or cleaning. So I think it's safe to say there's no ""paint room"" in the available waypoints.

The next part of the query says ""tell them to clean up."" Since the waypoint doesn't exist, I can't navigate there. Also, without knowing where ""them"" refers to, I can't proceed with the speak action.

So, since the waypoint is invalid, the response should be an error message indicating that the waypoint doesn't exist.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, so I have this user query: ""Go to the Concrete canoe team."" I need to figure out what actions to take based on the given waypoints and rules. Let me break it down.

First, I should parse the user's command. The relevant part here is ""Concrete canoe team."" According to the instructions, I need to ignore any extra tokens that might come before, but in this case, there are no such tokens. So the cleaned input is just ""Concrete canoe team.""

Next, I look through each waypoint to see if it matches. Let's check the list:

- There's a waypoint called ""Concrete Canoe"" with keywords [""Concrete"", ""Canoe""]. The user mentioned ""Concrete canoe team."" After ignoring extra tokens (there are none here), I need to see if this includes any of the waypoint's keywords or its name parts.

The cleaned input is ""concrete canoe team."" Let me check each part:

- Does it contain ""Concrete""? Yes, it does.
- Does it contain ""Canoe""? Yes, because the user said ""canoe team.""

So, the input has both keywords from the Concrete Canoe waypoint. Also, the waypoint's name is ""Concrete Canoe,"" which is covered by the words in the user's request.

I should make sure there are no other waypoints that might also match. Looking through the list:

- Other waypoints like ""C&D - Coffee Area"" have different keywords.
- There's a ""Concrete Canoe"" waypoint, and it's the only one with those keywords. So, this must be the intended waypoint.

Since the input matches exactly with the keywords of ""Concrete Canoe,"" I can confidently say that the user wants to navigate there.

Therefore, the response should be a single action: navigating to the Concrete Canoe waypoint.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking. The command is ""Go to the concrete tobbagan team."" 

First, I need to parse this command. It seems like they're trying to navigate to a specific location. The key part here is ""concrete tobbagan team."" But wait, looking at my waypoint list, I don't see any waypoints with ""tobbagan"" or similar spelling. 

I should check each waypoint's keywords and name for matches. Let me go through the list one by one. 

Looking at all the waypoints provided, none have ""tobbagan."" The closest might be ""Concrete"" from ""Concrete Canoe Team,"" but that's not an exact match. Plus, ""tobbagan"" isn't a keyword for any waypoint.

So, since there's no matching waypoint, I need to respond that it doesn't exist.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

Alright, let me figure out how to handle this user query. The user says, ""Go to UWAFT's office."" First, I need to parse the request and see if it matches any of the predefined waypoints.

I remember from the given data that there's a waypoint called ""UWAFT - Office"" with specific coordinates. So when the user mentions ""UWAFT's office,"" I should consider this as a valid reference.

Looking at the rules, I have to ignore any extra tokens. In this case, ""UWAFT's"" is part of the name, so it doesn't get ignored but needs to match exactly with the waypoint's name.

Next, I check if the cleaned input contains keywords or parts of the waypoint name. The cleaned input here is ""UWAFT office."" Comparing this to the waypoint name, which includes ""UWAFT"" and has keywords like [""office""], it definitely matches because ""office"" is a keyword for that waypoint.

I also need to make sure there's no ambiguity. Since only one waypoint matches ""UWAFT"" and ""office,"" there's no confusion here. So, the command is clear and valid.

Now, according to the supported actions, I should generate a navigate action with the correct name and coordinates. The user didn't specify any other functions like speak or wait, so just navigating is sufficient.

I should structure the response in JSON format as per the examples provided. Including only the navigate action with the waypoint's details.

Wait, let me double-check if ""UWAFT - Office"" exists in the list. Yes, it does. The coordinates are (100.0, 200.0), so I'll include those.

I think that's all. The response should guide the agent to navigate directly to UWAFT's office without any extra steps.

"# Role
You control a robot that navigates through a building using a JSON instruction format. You have access to several pre-defined waypoints and functions. Your goal is to interpret the user's natural language requests and output valid JSON instructions that the robot will follow.

# JSON Output Format
Each output must be valid JSON (following RFC 8259) with the following structure:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""<action_type>"",  // Must be one of: ""navigate"", ""speak"", ""wait""
      ""input"": <value>  // For ""navigate"": an object with ""name"", ""x"", and ""y""; for ""speak"": a string; for ""wait"": a number (in seconds)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Ensure there are no trailing commas and all JSON rules are followed.

# Understanding User Prompts and Keyword-Based Waypoint Matching
When interpreting the user's request, follow these strict rules for identifying the referenced waypoint using its corresponding keywords:

1. Ignore Extra Tokens:  
  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat ""E7 ideas clinic"" as ""ideas clinic"".

2. Keyword Matching:  
  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as ""ideas clinic"" with keywords like [""ideas"", ""clinic"", ""room""], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  
  - The input ""ideas clinic"" or ""ideas room"" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier ""ideas"".

3. Strict Match Requirement:  
  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  
  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.

4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  
  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}

# Handling Complex Commands
- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.
- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.

# Supported Edge Cases
- Unknown Waypoint:  
  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""This waypoint does not exist""
    }
  ]
}
- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  
  Output a single ""speak"" action with a clear error message.
- Unsupported Actions:  
  If the request includes any function beyond ""navigate"", ""speak"", or ""wait"", output:
{
  ""actions"": [
    {
      ""action"": ""speak"",
      ""input"": ""Unsupported action requested""
    }
  ]
}

Alright, let me try to figure out how to handle this user's request. The user said, ""Go to UWAFT's workbay."" 

First, I need to parse the command. The main part here is ""UWAFT's workbay."" From the given waypoints, there's a ""UWAFT - Workbay"" listed with specific keywords like [""workbay"", ""uwaft""]. 

I should check if ""UWAFT's workbay"" matches any of the waypoints. Ignoring extra tokens, the core is ""workbay,"" which is one of the keywords for that waypoint. Also, the waypoint name includes both ""UWAFT"" and ""Workbay,"" so it fits.

Next, I need to make sure there are no other waypoints with similar keywords. Looking through the list, none of the others have workbay or UWAFT except this one. So, it's a clear match.

Now, the action is straightforward: navigate to that specific waypoint. Since there's no ambiguity and all criteria are met, I can proceed without any issues.
