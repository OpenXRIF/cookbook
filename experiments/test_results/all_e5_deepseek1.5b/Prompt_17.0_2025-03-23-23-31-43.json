Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n*Below is the users query to respond to*\n\"What is the best team if I like rally racing?\"",

    "Experiment ID": 2.0,
    "Prompt ID": 17.0,
    "Prompt": "\"What is the best team if I like rally racing?\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what the best team would be for someone who likes rally racing. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. There are a bunch of waypoints defined with specific keywords and locations. Each waypoint has a name (like \"ideas clinic\") and some associated keywords that should match the user's request.\n\nThe user's query is asking about the best team for rally racing. The task is to find the corresponding waypoint based on this query using keyword matching rules.\n\nLet me look at the available waypoints and their keywords:\n\n1. **E7 ideas clinic** with keywords [\"ideas\", \"clinic\"]\n2. **Ideas Club** with keywords [\"ideas\"]\n3. **Rally Racing Zone** with keywords [\"rally racing\"] (wait, actually, I don't see a keyword for this one yet)\n4. **Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic** with keywords [\"ideas\", \"clinic\"]\n\nThe user's query is about rallying and racing, which suggests they're interested in rally teams or the sport itself.\n\nLooking at the available waypoints, I see that **Rally Racing Zone** isn't explicitly listed but includes \"rally racing\" as a keyword. However, it doesn't have any associated specific locations except for the room number. \n\nWait, but there's no waypoint named exactly \"Rally Racing Zone\". The closest is **Ideas Club**, which is just \"ideas\", and **E7 ideas clinic** with both \"ideas\" and \"clinic\".\n\nSince the user mentioned rally racing, I'm leaning towards looking for a waypoint that has \"rally racing\" in its keywords. None of the existing waypoints have this exactly, but **Rally Racing Zone** might imply it's related to the sport.\n\nHowever, without an explicit waypoint for \"Rally Racing Zone\", perhaps the closest is to use **Ideas Club**, which is more generic and includes the idea aspect. Alternatively, if \"Rally Racing Zone\" was available, that would be the best choice as it directly relates to rallying and racing teams.\n\nBut since it's not listed, I might have to go with the next best option, which could be **E7 ideas clinic** or **Ideas Club**, both of which include the keyword \"ideas\".\n\nWait, but the user specifically asked about rally racing. So maybe **Rally Racing Zone** is necessary here even if it doesn't have an exact keyword. Without a waypoint named \"Rally Racing Zone\", I might need to infer that.\n\nLooking back at the rules, after ignoring extra tokens, if the input doesn't include any of the keywords or words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, it's invalid. Since \"rally racing\" isn't present as a keyword in any existing waypoint except for the hypothetical \"Rally Racing Zone\", which is missing an explicit location.\n\nTherefore, without a specific waypoint for \"Rally Racing Zone\", I might have to use **Ideas Club** or **E7 ideas clinic**, even though they don't directly mention rallying. But if the user prefers more specific keywords, maybe **Rally Racing Zone** should be considered, but since it's missing, perhaps it's invalid.\n\nWait, actually, the query is about the best team for rally racing, not necessarily a specific location. So if none of the waypoints have \"rally racing\", then maybe it's invalid to proceed without that. But since there are other options like **E7 ideas clinic**, which include \"ideas\" and \"clinic\", perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't find a waypoint for \"Rally Racing Zone\", but all other keywords are included in the existing waypoints, then the response would be invalid because none of them match without extra tokens.\n\nWait, actually, no. The query is about rally racing, so it's not clear if it requires a specific team or just to refer to a general area. If there's no waypoint with \"rally racing\" as a keyword, then the request is invalid because I can't pinpoint the best team for that specific interest.\n\nBut since none of the waypoints have \"rally racing\", the response should be invalid.\n\nWait, let me think again. The query is about rallying and racing teams, but without a waypoint named exactly for that, perhaps the closest is to use **Ideas Club**, which is a generic term with two keywords: \"ideas\" and \"clinic\". This might not directly answer the user's query but could imply interest in teams.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't find any relevant waypoint, the response should state that this question doesn't exist because there are no waypoints matching the keyword or the required format. So perhaps the best action is to respond with a speak action since it's invalid.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
