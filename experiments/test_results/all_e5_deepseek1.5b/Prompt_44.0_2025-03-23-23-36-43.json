Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys?

    "Prompt": "\"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the user's query step by step. The query is: \"Go to the Formula Electric Mech Bay, then the Baja, the to Rocketry, then to Midnight Sun Then wait 5 minutes.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each waypoint represents and how they are connected based on their coordinates.\n\n1. **Formula Electric Mech Bay**: This is listed under \"FSAE\". From the data, it's at (250, 30). So that's one point.\n2. **Baja**: Under \"Best\", with a coordinate of (148, 96).\n3. **Rocketry**: Under \"Rocketry\", which is also under \"FSAE\" but I need to check the exact coordinates for Rocketry. Wait, looking back, I think Rocketry might be listed separately or perhaps it's another FSAE. Hmm, maybe I should verify that.\n\nWait, actually, in the given data, the available waypoints are:\n\n- E7 ideas clinic\n- E7 buildings\n- E7 roads\n- E7 ideas day\n- Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)\n- Baja\n- Rocketry\n\nEach with specific coordinates. Let me check each one:\n\n- **E7 ideas clinic**: No coordinates provided.\n- **E7 buildings**: Not a waypoint, just a building name.\n- **E7 roads**: Not a waypoint.\n- **E7 ideas day**: Not a waypoint.\n- **Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)**: Coordinates (250, 30)\n- **Baja**: Coordinates (148, 96)\n- **Rocketry**: I'm not sure about the coordinates. It might be listed under FSAE or as a separate waypoint.\n\nWait, looking back at the available waypoints provided:\n\nThey are:\n\n1. E7 ideas clinic\n2. E7 buildings\n3. E7 roads\n4. E7 ideas day\n5. Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)\n6. Baja\n7. Rocketry\n\nEach of these has specific coordinates, except perhaps Rocketry. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the data provided:\n\n- **E7 ideas clinic**: No coordinates.\n- **E7 buildings**: Not a waypoint.\n- **E7 roads**: Not a waypoint.\n- **E7 ideas day**: Not a waypoint.\n- **FEMB**: (250, 30)\n- **Baja**: (148, 96)\n- **Rocketry**: I think Rocketry is under \"Rocketry\" which has coordinates (-20, -21). Wait, no, looking back at the data provided, it's actually listed as:\n\nWait, in the data provided, each waypoint is like:\n\n\"E7 ideas day\" with (x,y)=(44,1), and \"FEMB\" is (250,30).\n\nBut for Rocketry, I don't see its coordinates. It might be listed under a different waypoint or perhaps it's an extra keyword. Wait, looking back at the data:\n\nThe available waypoints are:\n\n- E7 ideas day: (44,1)\n- FEMB: (250,30)\n- Baja: (148,96)\n\nAnd others like \"E7 buildings\" and \"E7 roads\". Maybe Rocketry is under another category or has coordinates. Wait, actually, the user included:\n\n\"Rocketry\":\n\n1. E7 Road 1\n2. E7 Road 2\n3. E7 Ideas Day\n4. FEMB\n5. Baja\n6. Rocketry\n\nWait, no, looking back at the provided data:\n\nThe available waypoints after \"E7 ideas day\" are:\n\n\"E7 buildings\" - No coordinates.\n\"E7 roads\" - No coordinates.\n\"E7 ideas day\" - (44,1)\n\"FEMB\" - (250,30)\n\"Baja\" - (148,96)\n\"Rocketry\":\n\n1. E7 Road 1\n2. E7 Road 2\n3. E7 Ideas Day\n4. FEMB\n5. Baja\n6. Rocketry\n\nWait, perhaps \"Rocketry\" is under a different waypoint. Alternatively, maybe it's listed as another waypoint with coordinates.\n\nBut looking at the data, each available waypoint has its own set of coordinates:\n\n- Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB) is at (250,30)\n- Baja is at (148,96)\n- Rocketry: Is there a coordinate for Rocketry? It's unclear. Maybe it's not listed as a waypoint but part of another group.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's query is about going to Formula Electric Mech Bay, then Baja, then Rocketry, then Midnight Sun, and waiting 5 minutes. So let's map each step to their coordinates:\n\n1. **Formula Electric Mech Bay (FEMB)**: (250,30)\n2. **Baja**: (148,96)\n3. **Rocketry**: Need to find its coordinates.\n\nWait, looking at the data provided, under \"E7 Road 1\", there are some coordinates:\n\n- E7 Road 1: Coordinates (-34, -15), (-30, -21), (36, -9). So Rocketry might be listed here? Or is it a different waypoint.\n\nWait, the available waypoints are:\n\n\"E7 buildings\" - No coords\n\"E7 roads\" - No coords\n\"E7 ideas day\" - (44,1)\n\"FEMB\" - (250,30)\n\"Baja\" - (148,96)\n*Rocketry*: E7 Road 1, E7 Road 2, E7 Ideas Day, FEMB, Baja, Rocketry. Wait, maybe Rocketry is under a different waypoint with specific coordinates.\n\nWait, looking at the data provided:\n\n- \"Rocketry\" has its own set of coordinates, but it's not listed as a separate waypoint in the given data. So perhaps each time we go to Rocketry, we need to see if there are coordinates for that specific instance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's list all the waypoints with their coordinates:\n\n1. E7 ideas day: (44,1)\n2. FEMB: (250,30)\n3. Baja: (148,96)\n4. Rocketry: Let's assume it has its own set of coordinates, but I don't see them listed here.\n\nWait, perhaps each \"Rocketry\" instance is under a different waypoint with specific coordinates. So for each step to Rocketry, we need to see what that coordinate is.\n\nBut in the given data, only FEMB and Baja are specified. The other options like E7 Road 1 have multiple coordinates. Maybe I should consider that each \"Rocketry\" instance has its own set of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo or misrepresentation, but based on the provided data, I'll proceed with the given coordinates.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Go to FEMB at (250,30)\n- Then to Baja at (148,96)\n- Then Rocketry. But where is its coordinate? It's unclear from the data. Maybe each \"Rocketry\" instance has a specific point.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back, the available waypoints are:\n\n\"E7 buildings\"\n\n\"E7 roads\"\n\n\"E7 ideas day\": (44,1)\n\n\"FEMB\": (250,30)\n\n\"Baja\": (148,96)\n\nAnd then \"Rocketry\" is a waypoint under \"E7 Road 1\":\n\n-E7 Road 1: (-34,-15), (-30,-21), (36,-9)\n-E7 Road 2: Let's assume it has its own coordinates\n-E7 Ideas Day: (44,1) - but that's the same as E7 ideas day.\n-FEMB: (250,30) - which is FEMB.\n\nSo perhaps Rocketry has coordinates like (-34,-15), etc., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant E7 Road 2 or another waypoint.\n\nBut based on the data provided, I'll proceed with the given coordinates.\n\nSo, after Baja at (148,96):\n\n- Next is Rocketry. If each \"Rocketry\" instance has its own coordinate, we need to see what that is. But it's unclear from the given data. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in listing them and forgot one of the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the waypoints with their coordinates:\n\n1. E7 ideas day: (44,1)\n2. FEMB: (250,30)\n3. Baja: (148,96)\n\nAssuming Rocketry is under a different waypoint with specific coordinates, perhaps it's not listed here.\n\nBut in the user's query, after FEMB, they go to Baja, then Rocketry, and then midnight sun.\n\nSo, if FEMB is at (250,30), Baja at (148,96), and then Rocketry needs its coordinate. If I can't find it here, maybe the user made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each \"Rocketry\" instance has a different coordinate. Let's say:\n\n-E7 Road 1: (-34,-15)\n-E7 Road 2: (some other coords)\nBut without knowing the exact coordinates for Rocketry, I can't map it precisely.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant that the next step after Baja is to Rocketry's own specific coordinate. But since we don't have that data here, maybe the answer should include a note that the coordinate isn't provided or requires further information.\n\nAlternatively, if each \"Rocketry\" instance has a set of coordinates, then:\n\n-E7 Road 1: (-34,-15), (some other coords)\n-Baja is at (148,96), so perhaps Rocketry after Baja would be on one of the E7 Road instances.\n\nBut without knowing the exact positions for each \"Rocketry\" instance, it's difficult to map this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume that each time you go to Rocketry, it's at (-34,-15). But I don't know if that's correct based on the data provided.\n\nI think the best approach is to list all the coordinates:\n\n- E7 ideas day: (44,1)\n- FEMB: (250,30)\n- Baja: (148,96)\n\nAssuming Rocketry has its own coordinate(s), perhaps it's not provided in the given data. Therefore, based on the information given, I can only map up to FEMB and Baja.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Start at E7 ideas day (44,1)\n- Then go to FEMB at (250,30)\n- Then to Baja at (148,96)\n\nAfter that, the user would need to know where Rocketry is located, which isn't provided in this data set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe after FEMB, they go to Baja, then to a different \"Rocketry\" instance somewhere else with specific coordinates, but without knowing those, it's hard to map.\n\nGiven the information, I think the answer is that you follow E7 ideas day (44,1), then to FEMB at (250,30), and then to Baja at (148,96). After that, if Rocketry is a separate instance, you would need its coordinate.\n\nBut since I don't have those coordinates here, perhaps the answer should note that rocketry's position isn't specified in this dataset.\n</think>\n\nTo follow the steps described:\n\n1. Begin at **E7 ideas day** located at the coordinates (44, 1).\n2. Proceed to **Fermi-Effective Field Theory (FEMB)** located at the coordinates (250, 30).\n3. Finally, visit **Baja** situated at the coordinates (148, 96).\n\nAfter these points, if Rocketry is a separate instance, you would need its specific coordinate information to be determined.\n\nFinal Answer:\n- E7 ideas day: \\boxed{(44, 1)}\n- FEMB: \\boxed{(250, 30)}\n- Baja: \\boxed{(148, 96)}",
