Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n*Below is the users query to respond to*\n\"Can you take me to the WFE bay please.\"",

    "Prompt": "\"Can you take me to the WFE bay please.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query using the provided waypoint system. The user said, \"Can you take me to the WFE bay please.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that each waypoint has keywords associated with them. For a given keyword input, it should match exactly one of these keywords. So, let me look at all the available waypoints and their corresponding keywords.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- E7 ideas clinic\n- F8 906\n- B7 345\n- G8 123\n- H8 567\n- I7 987\n- J7 701\n- K7 609\n- L7 709\n- M7 113\n- N6 439\n- O8 808\n- O9 456\n- P8 257\n- R8 890\n- S8 645\n- T8 584\n- U8 307\n- V8 162\n- W8 542\n- W8 356\n- X7 879\n- Y8 492\n- Z8 299\n\nEach of these has a set of keywords. The user just provided \"WFE bay.\" I need to check if this corresponds to any keyword in the list.\n\nWait, let me look at the description. The available functions are navigate, speak, and wait. So, each waypoint is associated with some keywords that must be met. For example, WFE bay might have keywords like \"WFE\" or other related terms. But I'm not seeing a direct match for \"WFE bay.\"\n\nLooking through each waypoint:\n\n- W8 542: Keywords include \"wayside.\" So, does WFE correspond to \"wayside\"? Maybe it's a different area.\n- W8 356: Same as above; still \"wayside.\"\n- I7 987: Doesn't seem related to WFE.\n\nI notice that some waypoints have similar names but aren't directly connected. For instance, E7 ideas clinic is under E7, but it doesn't relate to WFE. Similarly, F8 345 isn't directly relevant either.\n\nSo, since \"WFE bay\" doesn't match any of the keywords in the available waypoints, I need to check if that's an issue. The rules say to ignore extra tokens and look for exact matches. But here, the input is just \"WFE bay,\" which doesn't have a direct keyword from any waypoint.\n\nWait, maybe \"WFE\" isn't a keyword in the list provided? Let me double-check the keywords from the user prompt. No, I don't see \"WFE\" listed as a keyword anywhere. That means there's no way to match this input with any of the available waypoints based on their defined keywords.\n\nTherefore, according to rule 3, if extra tokens are ignored and the remaining text doesn't include any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for any given waypoint, then it's an invalid request. So, since \"WFE bay\" can't be matched with any keyword from the provided waypoints, this is a problem.\n\nThe response should be that this waypoint does not exist, and I need to provide a speak action explaining the issue.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
