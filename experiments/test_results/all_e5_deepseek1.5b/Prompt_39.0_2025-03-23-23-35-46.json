Ignore Extra Tokens:  \n  If the user's input begins with extra tokens (such as an alphanumeric building code or other prefixes), ignore them. For example, treat \"E7 ideas clinic\" as \"ideas clinic\".\n\n2. Keyword Matching:  \n  Each available waypoint comes with a set of keywords. For example, if a waypoint is defined as \"ideas clinic\" with keywords like [\"ideas\", \"clinic\", \"room\"], then a valid reference must include at least one or more of these keywords and the words in the waypoint name.  \n  - The input \"ideas clinic\" or \"ideas room\" should both match this waypoint because they include the core identifier \"ideas\".\n\n3. Strict Match Requirement:  \n  After ignoring extra tokens, if the remaining text does not contain any of the keywords or the words in the waypoint name for a given waypoint, or if more than one waypoint could be inferred without a clear winner, then the reference is considered invalid.  \n  In other words, a waypoint is only valid if the cleaned input contains at least one of the defined keywords or the words in the waypoint name for that waypoint and clearly points to one single available waypoint.\n\n4. Invalid Waypoint Response:  \n  If you determine that none of the available waypoints meets the keyword match criteria, output the following error response:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Handling Complex Commands\n- Process commands sequentially in the order provided.\n- For multi-step commands, list the actions in the exact order they should be executed.\n- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the interpretation that minimizes extra actions.\n\n# Supported Edge Cases\n- Unknown Waypoint:  \n  If, after ignoring extra tokens, the input does not include at least one of the corresponding keywords for any available waypoint, output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"This waypoint does not exist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n- Invalid or Ambiguous Commands:  \n  Output a single \"speak\" action with a clear error message.\n- Unsupported Actions:  \n  If the request includes any function beyond \"navigate\", \"speak\", or \"wait\", output:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Unsupported action requested\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Examples\nExample Prompt: Can you pick something up from the C and D areas and drop it off at the RoboHub?\nExample Answer:\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"C&D - Coffee Area\",\n                \"x\": 100,\n                \"y\": 100\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"action\": \"navigate\",\n            \"input\": {\n                \"name\": \"RoboHub Entrance\",\n                \"x\": 25,\n                \"y\": 50\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Can you ask Zach for the keys? He is at the RoboHub. After receiving the keys, drop them off at the Ideas Clinic. Also, wait for 10 seconds when you meet Zach.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"RoboHub\",\n        \"x\": 100,\n        \"y\": 100\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Hey Zach, can you hand me the keys?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"wait\",\n      \"input\": 10\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Room 1427 - Ideas Clinic\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample Prompt: Please go to the unknown zone and then to the RoboHub.\nExample Answer:\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"speak\",\n      \"input\": \"Invalid request: 'unknown zone' is not a valid waypoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n*Below is the users query to respond to*\n\"Take me to the bathroom.\"",

    "Prompt ID": 39.0,
    "Prompt": "\"Take me to the bathroom.\"",
    "Full LLM Response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's instruction. The user says, \"Take me to the bathroom.\" First, I should identify which waypoints are available and their corresponding keywords.\n\nLooking through the list, there's a waypoint called \"Take Me to the Bathroom\" with the name \"Bathroom\". So, that's one keyword: \"bathroom\". Also, it includes the words \"take\", \"me\", \"to\", and \"the\".\n\nNext, I need to consider if there are other keywords or related terms. The user is asking for a bathroom, so I should check all available waypoints.\n\nWait, let me list out the key points:\n\n1. Ignore extra tokens: The input doesn't have any prefixes like \"E7 ideas clinic\" or any other code, so it's straightforward.\n\n2. Keyword matching: The waypoint \"Bathroom\" has keywords [\"bathroom\", \"take\", \"me\", \"to\"], which include exactly what the user is asking for. So that fits perfectly.\n\n3. Strict match requirement: Since the cleaned input contains all necessary keywords and points directly to a single valid waypoint, there's no ambiguity here. It doesn't seem like multiple waypoints would fit because the bathroom keyword is unique in this list.\n\n4. Handling complex commands: The user didn't request any functions beyond navigation or speaking; they just want to navigate to the bathroom. So I don't need to list additional actions beyond what's required.\n\n5. Examples show that for a simple command like asking for something, the system navigates and speaks accordingly. Similarly, requesting help would be handled by wait or speak commands.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the response should guide the user to navigate to the bathroom and ask if they need assistance. That makes sense because each step is clearly outlined.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"navigate\",\n      \"input\": {\n        \"name\": \"Bathroom\",\n        \"x\": 25,\n        \"y\": 75\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
